Unused disaster (?):
 MySpecies
  "Captain. We regret to inform you that the citizens of planet ~mission_target_planet~ are on strike and refuse to produce more Spice. Furthermore, they are threatening to reallocate the current Spice storage out of the Space Program and into more terrestrial pursuits.~p~It seems they have gone so long without a visit from you that they are failing to realize how the Space Program benefits them. I'm sure a simple visit from you would be the key to motivating them.~p~We hope to see you soon before the Spice is reallocated.~p~Planet ~mission_target_planet~ Out."

Player helped with disaster:
 MySpecies
  "Thanks for showing up. Without you, this would have been a real nightmare. We really appreciate your help!"

 Ecologist

 Bard
  "Joyous day! We're clever, but not clever enough to guess what might have happened without your help! You have our thanks."

  "Thanks for the help! I bet we couldn't have done it without you. Keep in mind, I don't bet too often... We're market opportunists, not gamblers."
  "Thanks for keeping us in business! You can't even begin to imagine how much profit we stood to lose without your intervention."
  "Thanks for helping out! This kind of external assistance is exactly what helps us maintain our low, low insurance premiums."

Player did not help with disaster:
 MySpecies
  "Hey, where were you? You had better not make a habit of disappearing when trouble shows up."
  "Thanks for nothing! You've got that fancy flying contraption, so how about you use it to help out every now and then?"
  "Well, thanks for showing up... Too bad you came too late to do anything useful. Try to be a little more responsive in the future."
 Diplomat
  "The situation has already been resolved without your help. In the future, should we call upon you for assistance, we would appreciate your promptness."
  "I'm sorry, but twelve of the thirteen Official Keepers of Subjective Time agree that you have arrived too late to be useful. Thank you for coming."
  "You're too late. We already deployed our Emergency Protocol for Times of Moderate to Severe Crisis. All that's left is paperwork, and we can handle that ourselves, thank you."
 Ecologist
  "Not to be harsh, but you need to be a little more... responsive, you know? You totally missed all the action."
  "Nature can fend for itself, but it still likes the help, you know? Things could have gone better... if you had been here."
  "Sorry, but you're way too late to help. It's all right. Life goes on. It would go on better, though, if you responded faster in the future."
 Bard
  "Oh, calamity, despair! You have arrived too late to be of any use. Perhaps in the future, as you sing and dance and cavort throughout the universe, you could also pay attention to the passage of time?"
  "Let us tell you a story... it involves the ~player_species~, and the ~race~, and our utter disappointment at the lack of timely assistance. You should be able to guess how the story goes."
  "Hooray for the ~player_species~!' That's what we might have sung, had you shown up in time to do anything. It's far too late now, of course."
 Zealot
  "The ~player_species~ send aid, but they send it too late to be of use. Thine fault is tardiness, under the Judgement of Spode."
  "We have handled the situation ourselves, a thousand thanks be to Spode. No thanks be to the ~player_species~ for their un-timeliness."
  "The ~race~ emerge unscathed, all glory and thanks be to Spode. Shouldst thou wish to share in future glories, thou shalt be prompt in response."

 Trader
  "Thanks for showing up, but the losses are already on the books at this point. A ~player_creature_name~ like yourself must have lots of important things to do."
  "Phew, that was a close one! You wouldn't believe how close it was. You might have seen how close it was, if you had shown up in time! Actually, it wouldn't have been close at all with your help. But it's too late to change that now. Too late, indeed."
  "It's too late to do anything now. Just between us, you should be glad that our lawyers aren't pressing you for damages due to tardiness."
 Shaman
  "It is over and finished. Thank you for your eventual arrival, friend, but there is nothing left to be done."
  "We have handled the situation ourselves. We thank you for coming, but you are too late to be of assistance."
  "It is too late, friend. Please do not apologize, a hand extended in time is worth a thousand apologies after the fact."
 Warrior
  "~player_species~ is late. Too late. We ~race~ have dealt with the situation for now."
  "~player_species~ comes to help, but the time for help is already over."
  "~player_species~ arrives too late to help us. Next time ~player_species~ must not be late."

  "We were trying to explain numerology to the Grox, and they attacked us! We're busy right now... Come back later."
 Warrior
  "We're mobilizing our forces after an unprovoked attack by the Grox. We're too busy to deal with you right now... Maybe later."
