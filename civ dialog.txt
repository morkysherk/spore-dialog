Player calls nation:
 Military (Furious)
  "You attack us in our homes! What purpose do you have for this madness? You must know that this will not be tolerated."
 Military (Annoyed)
  "Our military gathers at your borders. We greet you only to mock you. "
  "We have little to say to you. Make your point."
 Military (Pleased)
  "We are pleased with our relations. How can we assist you?"
  "You are a fine ally. What is that you wish to speak about?"
 Military (After capturing player city)
  "Our mighty forces have taken one of your cities! Have you come to beg for the return of ~source_captured_player_city_name~?"
 Military (After losing city to player)
  "Your defiling of ~source_lost_city_to_player_name~ is the last of a litany of mistakes. We will not let you retain it easily. "
 Military (After capturing NPC city)
  "Our nation continues to expand. ~source_captured_npc_city_name~ is another fine addition in our quest for dominance. What is your purpose in contacting us?"
 Military
  "Your civilization perplexes us. What are your intentions?"

  "We have conquered your pitiful city of ~source_captured_player_city_name~. Soon, it too, will understand the true meaning of our faith."

 Religious (After capturing NPC city)
  " Our influence continues to expand! Our crusade has added the city of ~source_captured_npc_city_name~ to our nation."

 Economic (Furious)
  "There is no need for armed conflict but you have chosen to bring it to our city. We are saddened beyond reckoning. "
 Economic (Annoyed)
  "Your existence threatens the very existence of this planet. What could you possible want from us?"
  "Rarely have we seen a threat such as yours. Are you a force for good or evil?"
 Economic (Pleased)
  "Greetings! Actions speak louder than words in the market, and you seem a pleasant enough neighbor at present. What do you need?"
