Tutorial mission menu (old?):
 MySpecies
  "Excited Scientists have created SETI device and equipped it on your spaceship. It is capable of locating other life forms living on distant planets, but you'll need to be in deep space to use it.~p~We are all fascinated that you made contact with an Alien race, albeit a deceased one, but there clearly must be more. These Grox sound interesting and perhaps a bit dangerous. We'll need to explore the riches of the galaxy and expand our empire to continue to invest in our burgeoning space program. Captain, we have many missions for you to take on for your people, colonizing, exploring, etc. What would you like to take on first?"
