 Bard

 MySpecies
  "We've discovered life on ~mission_target_planet~ and the world now requires a survey. Can you perform a survey for us?"
  "~mission_target_planet~ may be suitable for settlement, but before we can be certain, we need a survey. Can you provide one?"
  "Data on ~mission_target_planet~ went missing in a pirate raid. Can you provide a survey? "
 Diplomat
  "In accordance with a directive of the Grand Council to discover other worlds for possible settlement, an unmanned probe has discovered life on ~mission_target_planet~. You would have the thanks of the Grand Council if you would be willing to evaluate this world for us."
  "In order to better protect our citizens, the Grand Council has declared a security zone that includes ~mission_target_planet~. It would aid our efforts if we could settle this world, but an adequate survey does not exist. Would you undertake such a survey on our behalf?"
  "The Grand Council encourages increased knowledge of all worlds, cultures, and biomes. Would you be willing to aid in increasing our knowledge? "
 Ecologist
  "In order to better understand the galactic Life Web and our place in it, we try to collect data from every possible source. Could you travel to ~mission_target_planet~ on our behalf and perform some scans?"

  "We found a secluded little planet that might make a terrific rustic getaway, but for all we know, everything in the environment might kill us! Would it be possible for you to survey ~mission_target_planet~ for us? "
 Zealot
  "In order to fulfill Spode's Grand Design, we need a scan of all life-forms on ~mission_target_planet~. If you were willing to do this for us, we might have more work for you. "
  "Our theologians desire that all living things be recorded in the Book of Existence, and categorized as clean or unclean. Can you travel to ~mission_target_planet~, and there scan all living things?"
  "Praise Spode! A new world has been discovered teeming with Spode's handiwork! Can you travel to ~mission_target_planet~ and make a survey?"
 Scientist
  "New life forms have been discovered on ~mission_target_planet~, but the world has not yet received an adequate survey. Would you be willing to undertake this task?"

  "~mission_target_planet~ has been scheduled for a survey, but our Exploration Service is overextended. Will you complete the survey for us?"
 Trader
  "A delightful new world has been discovered at ~mission_target_star~! In order to determine which of our vast industrial cartels may best plunder its resources, a planetary survey is necessary. Can you bestir your greatness in order to help us, in exchange of course for considerable reward?"
  "Oh, I am a wretched being! The world of ~mission_target_planet~ requires a survey, but I have no surveyors! Instead, all I have is money lying around in heaps! ~p~Perhaps a solution may occur to your vast intelligence?"
  "Happily we do the Dance of Acquirement! The real estate market at ~mission_target_planet~ is ready to zoom for the stratosphere! All that is required is a survey, so that we can best determine where to place our settlements. ~p~Perhaps your great mind can be put to this matter, if we make it worth your while?"
 Shaman
  "We've found a new world full of life! In order to discover if anything on this world can be used as props in our ceremonies, we need a full survey. Could you possibly do a survey for us?"
  "The aura of ~mission_target_planet~ sparkles with life, but we don't know what kind. There could be something there that could aid our spiritual growth! Could you travel there and do a survey? "
  "The Ascended Master Phrax, channeled by one of our seers, informs us that ~mission_target_planet~ may contain an object that will help us vibrate at a higher frequency! Could you possibly survey this world for us?"
 Warrior
  "~mission_target_planet~ has been placed within our security zone, but the world has not yet had a complete survey. Would you be willing to help us?"
  "Our recon teams are committed to a long-term project elsewhere, just as we need a survey of ~mission_target_planet~. Will you survey the world for us?"
  "~mission_target_planet~ needs a thorough survey to make certain that our settlers have no unpleasant surprises waiting for them. Would you be willing to make such a survey?"

 Zealot
  "Spode be praised! Your scans show that the planet holds a supply of ~mission_item~. In accordance with the Forty-First Prophecy of Spode, ~mission_item~ must be brought to this, our own world. Will you perform for us this holy task?"
  "You have located for us ~mission_item~, which some believe to be the 'arthngleb' referred to in Spode's Forty-First Prophecy! A supply must be brought here at once! Will you take this blessing unto yourself?"

Scan/Fetch Mission rejected 1:
 MySpecies
  "Well, this is a bit of a disappointment. We had hoped we could entice you. ~p~This mission may seem ordinary, but it's potentially *extremely* important to our species. ~p~It's a shame we'll have to put the job in less capable hands."
 Diplomat
  "We will not insist. Goodbye. "
 Ecologist
  "We'll manage the scans ourselves then."
 Bard
  "Not interested? Not even a little bit? Oh well."
 Zealot
  "Obviously it is not for infidels such as yourselves to further Spode's Grand Design."
 Scientist
  "If you insist. Goodbye. "
 Trader
  "We'll have to keep all the money for ourselves then. "
 Shaman
  "I suppose we'll have to keep these spiritual riches to ourselves."
 Warrior
  "You reject the opportunity for knowledge. Very well."
 Grob

  "How could you do this!?! You don't know how crucial this next step of your mission is to us! ~p~Leave the job half done and maybe we should give your expensive spacecraft to someone who will use it better."
 Diplomat
  "It is not in our interests to compel you."
 Ecologist
  "That's unfortunate. We'll manage the work ourselves then, sooner or later."
 Bard
  "But you've been our perfect tool so far!"
 Zealot
  "Surely Spode has not entered into your heart!"
 Scientist
  "In that case, we shall manage this matter ourselves."
 Trader
  "Not even the prospect of a great reward tempts you? You are unique in the galaxy!"
 Shaman
  "Why stop now?"
 Warrior
  "In that case we shall harvest this item ourselves."

 Bard
  "We're trying not to be impatient, but we notice you haven't returned with your scans from ~mission_target_planet~. Look in your Mission Log if it's somehow slipped your mind. "
 Zealot
  "You haven't provided the scans from ~mission_target_planet~. All necessary information should be in your Mission Log! Spode's Grand Design must not be delayed!"
 Scientist
  "We were hoping to analyze the scans from ~mission_target_planet~. What went wrong? Have you clumsily deleted them from your Mission Log?"
 Trader
  "Where are our glorious profits? You haven't provided the scans from ~mission_target_planet~. All necessary information should be in your Mission Log! "
 Shaman
  "After all our chanting, you still haven't got the scans from ~mission_target_planet~. Could you check your Mission Log for the details and head straight there? "
 Warrior
  "You haven't returned with the scans from ~mission_target_planet~. Did your Mission Log contain incomplete instructions?"
 Grob

 Ecologist
  "You were going to bring us a supply of ~mission_item~. Check your Mission Log for a record of our agreement."
 Bard
  "Say... where's the ~mission_item~? Time's a-wasting!"
 Zealot
  "Spode's Forty-First Prophecy remains incomplete! Look into your Mission Log as if it were a holy book, and fetch us the ~mission_item~ at once!"
 Scientist
  "We note that you have not returned with ~mission_item~, as you agreed. Have all the details been erased from your Mission Log?"
 Trader
  "Here we are standing on all these great stacks of Sporebucks and you haven't brought the ~mission_item~?"
 Shaman
  "We're all for people hanging loose and doing their own thing, but didn't you tell us you'd bring us some ~mission_item~? Our clairvoyants say that the information is in your Mission Log."
 Warrior

You'd really be doing us a favor if you'd haul over to the ~mission_target_star~ system, and brought us back a sprout of the ~mission_item~ herb from planet ~mission_target_planet~.

Totally. ~p~You see, the Emperor's birthday is coming up, and the old coot is always talking about how the royal gardens are missing a ~mission_item~ plant. If I had one, It'd totally make the other gifts look like Grox-fertilizer! It'd be so awesome!"

May we tempt you with a suitable reward? "

  "We have discovered a new world that may be suitable for exploitation by our industrial cartels! A survey of its natural resources needs to be conducted first, so we know which industries will be suitable. Perhaps we could tempt you to conduct such a survey if the rewards are suitable?"
 Shaman
  "We've discovered a new world at ~mission_target_star~. One of our crack psychics dreamed that one of the life-forms on this world will help us to form ectoplasm. Would you help us with this discovery?"
  "We've discovered a brand new world, pristine in its splendor! We need to determine whether it will be a proper sanctuary for aura balancers, crystal gazers, card readers, mediums, telephone sanitizers, or all of the above! Will you help us with a survey?"
  "Out of the One come the Many, and out of the Many come the Many More, but yet all remain One, save for those which are not firm in their Oneness! Among the Many More is a newly discovered planet, planet ~mission_target_planet~. We don't know whether it's part of the One or the Not-Oneness, and for that we need a survey. Would you oblige us? "
 Warrior
  "Would ya look at this miserable heap we've been calling home! We're sick of it! All of it! Everything! The whole ecosystem! ~p~We've been far too forgiving of our plants and animals for far too long. It's time for them to go! ~p~We need you to find planet ~mission_target_planet~ and gather up one of each of it's plant and animal species. We're gonna swap 'em in for the sorry waste of DNA currently wastin' space on this rock. Perhaps this new lot will amuse us."
  "Our recon teams are busy performing reconnaissance elsewhere, and are unable to complete a proper survey of planet ~mission_target_planet~. Are you willing to stand in for them?"
  "We intend to settle planet ~mission_target_planet~, but the world first requires a survey. Would you be willing to aid us?"
  "Our fleet is elsewhere right now, on maneuvers intended to intimidate our neighbors. In the meantime planet ~mission_target_planet~ needs a survey. Are you interested? "
 Grob

  "Planet ~mission_target_planet~ requires an inventory of all plants and animals. You have nothing better to do."
  "Our study of ecocide requires further specimens. You will provide these."

  "The plants of planet ~mission_source_planet~ here were transplanted from planet ~mission_target_planet~. Unfortunately we were guilty of a little, um, over-celebration during the trip back, and we sort of forgot where planet ~mission_target_planet~ actually is, though we're pretty sure it's in the vicinity of ~group:star_clue~. ~p~Once you find the planet ~mission_target_planet~, beam up one of every living thing, and bring them to us here at planet ~mission_source_planet~.

Sample Collection Mission accepted:
 MySpecies
  "Excellent. We knew we could count on you. You've always served the interests of the ~mission_source_empire~ so faithfully. ~p~May the cosmos deliver you swiftly and surely to planet ~mission_target_planet~. ~p~These arcology projects of ours perform an important galactic function. It would be such a shame to lose an entire planetary biome, so it's always good to have a back-up copy."
  "Thanks! With luck, this planet will prove perfect for settlement!"
 Diplomat
  "The Grand Council offers its thanks. Please travel to ~mission_target_planet~ at once."
 Ecologist
  "Thank you for this contribution to our knowledge of planet ~mission_target_planet~."
 Bard
  "All the sumptuous wonders of the cosmos are about to unfurl in our mouths, one bite at a time! You will enter into the annals of gastronomic history upon your return, and shall be celebrated as a culinary hero and bon vivant par excellence until the very fabric of time is torn asunder! ~p~My mouth waters at the very thought of the meal to come. No, that's not right. I *slaver* at the thought of this planetary feast. I've lost all sense of decorum and shame!"
  "Great! We'll look forward to your returning with a cargo hold full of with frondy and furry things! "
 Zealot
  "Let the mission go forth! May Spode light your way. "
 Scientist
  "Thank you. Our xenobiologists will sharpen their dissecting knives and await your return."
  "Excellent! We shall start choosing settlers from a pool of volunteers."
  "We shall look forward to the results of this test of your intelligence. "
 Trader
  "Great! You're a good person, helping us out like this. Did you know that?~p~We'd go ourselves, but generally once we get just past the heliopause, someone will wonder if they left the faucet on. Naturally, that causes the usual panic, and before you know it, we have to turn the ship around. ~p~So, before you leave, make sure you haven't left the iron on or anything like that, okay?"
  "We can barely contain our urge to begin speculating in the real estate market! Please travel to ~mission_target_planet~ and return with flora and fauna bulging from your cargo holds!"
 Shaman
  "Wonderful! May positive energies light your way. "
 Warrior
  "Aww hey, thanks, pally. You're ugly, but you're our kind of ugly, and we like that. ~p~Well, you best be on your way. That planet ain't gonna find itself. ~p~So, you know, skedaddle. Scram. Vamoose. "

Sample Collection Mission rejected:
 MySpecies
  "This is a terrible disappointment, and a mark on your record, to be sure. ~p~Mostly, it's just surprising. I've seen your file, and this doesn't sound like the fearless adventurer I read about. ~p~I guess I'll just find someone else."
  "Aw c'mon! It'll be fun! "
 Diplomat
  "Very well. We shall collect its samples by other means. Farewell."
 Ecologist
  "We'll manage the survey ourselves, then. Goodbye. "
 Bard
  "Oh, this is such a crushing disappointment! How we had longed for the subtle and complementary interplay of tastes and textures that can only be found on this particular planet. ~p~Doubtless, we will eventually encounter another adventurous gastronome willing to aid us in our epicurean endeavors. Still, we remain in a constant state of anticipation over the thought of this new taste sensation. We yearn hungrily for all novel sybaritic pleasures of the mouth organ!"
  "You don't want to check out this new world? Do you have allergies, too?"
 Zealot
  "Such unenlightened beings as you are too limited to appreciate Spode's glory. Goodbye. "
 Scientist
  "Sorry, we'd forgotten your species' curiosity about the natural world was limited. Goodbye."
 Trader
  "Oh. Well, this is a terrible disappointment. We rarely get visitors (of the non-vandalizing variety), so it'll probably be a while before we can find someone else willing to help. ~p~And we'd do it ourselves, but we can't do anything that involves heavy lifting. Our lower back problems are well documented in the medical literature, you know."
  "Apparently ~player_creature_name~ are too mighty to amuse themselves with natural history. Perhaps you would prefer a visit to our emporium?"
 Shaman
  "I suppose we can't expect such non-actualized beings as yourselves to be interested in these important matters."
 Warrior
  "Why, I oughta! No one rejects the ~race~! You shall pay a terrible, terrible price! We shall - URK!!! ~p~We shall - HUNNGH! ~p~We - NYAAAGH! ~p~We shall take our heart medication, and quickly! We will deal with you later. Just leave us alone."

  "We're entering negotiations with the inhabitants of planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~. As a favor to them, we would like you to deliver a few things which will make a partnership more attractive.~p~Please find some ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts and deliver them to planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~."

  "Our automated data probes have detected a surprising number of ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts in this star system. We don't know what this means, but there are specialists on planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~ who could possibly tell us. Can you find these rare items and deliver them for us?"
  "Pirates have been smuggling exotic ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts from other worlds, and they're bringing them through our star system! We've discovered the location of several drop points that the pirates are using to temporarily store the ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts.~p~We would like you to find the smuggled goods and return them to their rightful owners on planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~."
 Diplomat
  "A series of ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts were created to commemorate the anniversary of our federation. Some of these were stolen during pirate raids. It has recently come to the Grand Council's attention that these missing artifacts are being stored on other planets.~p~Please retrieve them and deliver them to ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~ for the Festival of Federation."
  "An ancient text, the creation of a vanished race, has recently been discovered. It refers to several ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts stored on nearby planets. Under the bylaws of our federation, these historic objects must be collected and catalogued and placed into appropriate storage on planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~. Will you do this?"
  "We have encountered traces of an ancient civilization that seems to have been wiped out by the Grox. There are references to a series of ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts which may contain information about the Grox.~p~As subsection 52, paragraph 7 of our federation bylaws clearly states, all information about the Grox must be stored in a maximum security facility. Please find and collect these items and bring them to the facility on planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~."
 Ecologist
  "Have you seen planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~? The whole place has such a beautiful aura... totally awe-inspiring. It inspired us to send the people a little something, you know? We were thinking that some ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics would be really great.~p~Just, uh, one thing. We don't have any... You'll have to search for them."
  "Nature, ~player_creature_name~. It's all around us. It's inside of everything, and everything is a part of nature. Even inanimate things like ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics. They are still our brothers in nature, and I can hear them talking to us. No I'm not crazy, I can really hear them. They want us to find them and take them to ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~.~p~Can you give them a lift?"
  "The inhabitants of planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~ are freaking out. They're looking for ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics, but can't find any. There's plenty of them in this star system... You should totally go help the situation.~p~Go find a bunch of ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics. Bring them to planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~ to chill everybody out."
  "Someone from planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~ told us that ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics hold clues to the great secrets of nature and the Universe. There are some in our star system... but we haven't figured it out. This secret must be really deep, you know. Heavy stuff.~p~Find some ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics and bring them to planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~... Maybe they can work out what it all means."
 Bard
  "On planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~, people say that there's nothing finer than a ~mission_multi_delivery_item~. Is it true? Maybe it is, and maybe it's not, but I don't care as long as that's what they want!~p~I'm sure there are some ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics in our star system. Could you round them up and bring them over to planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~?"
  "Once upon a time, ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts were all the rage in our civilization! Then they fell out of favor, and people hid them far away out of embarrassment. Now they're in style again, and the residents of planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~ are desperate to have them! So sad, no originality... Slaves to fashion! But then again, who am I to judge?~p~Do you think you can find some ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts and deliver them to planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~?"
  "Would you like to go on a wild ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifact chase? The people of planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~ would absolutely love to get their hands on some ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts.

  "Spode's own sacred appendages created a series of ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics. These were lost in the tumultuous War of Spodification.~p~Through Spode's holy guidance, we have detected some of the ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics close by. Will you find them and bring them to planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~, that the inhabitants might bow down before them?"
  "Believers in the false God that Shall Become have created ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics and hidden them on other planets in this star system! Thanks be to Spode, we have discovered their existence. Will you search for these items and bring them to ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~ so that they may be destroyed?"
  "Long ago, far in the history of our species, ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts were treated as holy relics.

Can you find them and complete the delivery?"
  "We have decoded a document from an vanished alien species that informs us of ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics scattered on different worlds. Analysis of these items would not only tell us about this ancient species, but might shed light on current mysteries as well. The best facilities for this analysis are located on planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~.~p~Would you be willing to acquire these items and bring them to planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~?"
  "In the Centennial Year of the Rule of Reason, an accident resulted in the scattering of many ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics across nearby planets. All but a few of these have since been recovered, and are now stored in our museum on planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~. Can you finish the recovery? The remaining ones are all in this star system."
 Trader
  "Do you detect something in the air? Of course you do, because I do, and we both know you're every bit as clever as I am! There's profit to be made, I can smell it!

  "When you have a reputation like we do, and boy do we have a reputation, sometimes fortune just drops into your lap. We just heard through the spacevine that there's a demand for ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts on planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~. And does a smart ~player_creature_name~ like you know how rare those things are? That's right! They're not rare at all around here!~p~We've got our hands full with committed deals already, so why don't you handle this one for us? Fly around and collect some ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts. Bring them to planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~, and head back here for your cut of the profits."
  "Hey, how do you feel about ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics? Like them? Hate them? Don't know what they are? It doesn't matter, all you need to do is collect them from some nearby planets.~p~We just won a contract to deliver a bunch of these to planet ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~. We need someone to go search for them, and you look just the ~player_creature_name~ for the job!"
 Shaman
  "We've discovered ancient scrolls informing us that ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics are inscribed with secrets of the universe!

  "We require ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics for the annual Ceremony of Actualization! The ceremony takes place on ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_planet~. Can you help us find some ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ relics and deliver them to the Actualization Academy for the ceremony?"
  "I've heard it said that 'Those Who Went Before have placed the Items That Went Ahead on Worlds That Are Not Yet Gone'.

Eradicate Animals Mission briefing 1:
 MySpecies
  "Plague-ridden animals are attacking our settlement on  planet ~mission_target_planet~! We need your help!"
  "A carnivorous animal species is attacking on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Can you aid us?"
  "A harmless virus on planet ~mission_target_planet~ has mutated into a threat to wildlife. Will you give us help?"
 Diplomat
  "In order that the inhabitants of planet ~mission_target_planet~ be secure, they must be made safe from predatory life-forms. Would you be willing to undertake a mission to eradicate the carnivorous ~mission_target_animal_species~ from planet ~mission_target_planet~?"
  " The Grand Council guarantees that our citizens shall live free from fear. A sub-contractor surveying planet ~mission_target_planet~ prior to settlement failed to notice that the herbivores known as ~mission_target_animal_species~ were about to enter a carnivorous cycle. The Grand Council would be pleased if you were to aid in eradicating planet ~mission_target_planet~ of this menace."
 Ecologist
  "Oh, we're so lucky you came along! We have an urgent task, but we don't have the heart to carry it out ourselves. It's too awful!~p~It's the adorable ~mission_target_animal_species~ species! ~mission_num_kills_needed~ of them have come down with the dreaded Oogie Fever! If it spreads, it'll wipe them all out!~p~The infected animals must be... *gulp*... eradicated.~p~We'll pay you! ~mission_rewards~ Spucks. Sound good?"
  "A plague has spread among the animals of planet ~mission_target_planet~. This threatens to unhinge the planet's entire ecology! Can you help us avert disaster by eradicating the infected animals!"
  "Illegal gene-hackers have altered the DNA of one of the animals on planet ~mission_target_planet~, and it has now become a menace to other animals and even to our citizens! Can you help us?"
  "While we try to be at one with Nature, sometimes Nature's method of being at one with us involves having us for dinner. Such is the case on ~mission_target_planet~, where a mutation has turned one of the animals belligerent. We shrink from bloodshed, so will you take the necessary action?"
 Bard
  "You want something to do? Why, sure. We got something that'll get rid of you. I mean, we have a task.~p~Why don't you... oh, I don't know... let's say... kill ~mission_num_kills_needed~ specific ~mission_target_animal_species~ ~^p^mission_num_kills_needed^creature^creatures~.~p~Yeah, that sounds like it could take you a while. Do that.~p~We'll pay you. How's... ~mission_rewards~ Spucks sound? Will that be enough to get you to leave?"
  "Fortune smiles upon you today, my fair entity. We have just such a task!~p~We have entered planet ~mission_target_planet~ in the Spaceminster Planetary Show-off Exhibition. It's the most prestigious event of its kind, and we've worked so hard preparing planet ~mission_target_planet~. Everything is just perfect!~p~Almost perfect, to be more precise. A small passel of ~mission_target_animal_species~ refuse to behave properly. The show is nearly upon us. Sadly, they must be eradicated."
  "There is nothing more pathetic than a fashion gone out of date. We are no longer amused by our mutant glow beasts on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Will you dispose of them for us?"
  "The joke is certainly on us! For aesthetic reasons, we created genetically altered animals on planet ~mission_target_planet~. They're very pretty, but now they're eating us! Can you keep us from becoming lunch?"
  "We went on a joyride and glow-splotched some of the animals on planet ~mission_target_planet~. How were we to know that glow-splotching infuriates this species? Can you aid us by turning the rampaging animals into aesthetically-satisfying cones of ash?"
 Zealot
  "Our sanctuary on planet ~mission_target_planet~, heretofore a model of zeal and piety, is now threatened by fiery, demonic beings. Will you deliver the faithful from this menace?"
  "Followers of the false God that Will Come have spread a plague among the animals of planet ~mission_target_planet~. Can you help us eradicate this menace?"
  "According to the laws of Spode, animals should be a help to the faithful. Yet a species of animal has risen up to plague the righteous! Will you aid us in destroying this unnatural menace?"
 Scientist
  "~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. A misplaced digit in a planetary survey has resulted in one of our planets in the ~mission_source_empire~ being seeded with the wrong sub-species. This aggressive animal is not only attacking other animals, but has become a threat to our citizens.~p~Would you be interested in helping us eradicating ~mission_target_animal_species~ from planet ~mission_target_planet~?"
  "~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. We regret to report that one of our experiments has not fulfilled its expectations. Instead of a placid, domesticated animal, a malprogrammed gene-splicer has inadvertently produced a ferocious, carnivorous species on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Will you be interested in helping us to rectify this error?"
  "~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. An unknown plague has begun to affect animals on planet ~mission_target_planet~, turning them into dangerous predators. May we employ you to eradicate them?"
  "~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. An experiment in herbivory has gone disastrously wrong on planet ~mission_target_planet~, resulting in a formerly harmless species going mad and attacking other animals and even pack members. Can you help us with our little problem?"
 Trader
  "This miserable being is reluctant to bring himself to your attention, but an emergency compels him. A peaceful settlement of ~mission_source_empire~ has been attacked by predatory life-forms. This wretched one hopes you will be willing to undertake a mission to eradicate the carnivorous ~mission_target_animal_species~ from planet ~mission_target_planet~. A successful mission will be blessed with rewards!"
  "I am doleful at having to disturb your excellence with this news, but I am reluctantly compelled to inform you that planet ~mission_target_planet~ has been attacked by ravenous beasts, endangering the happiness of our people. In return for rewards, would you be willing to deal with this emergency?"
  "Woe is us! Word has reached our ears that a plague has spread among the animals of planet ~mission_target_planet~, turning them aggressive and violent. Humbly we request that your splendor, in return for adequate rewards, destroy these beasts."
 Shaman
  "One of our Chanting Circles on planet ~mission_target_planet~ seems to have called up the wrong spirit! We were hoping for a chat with our late Auntie Flrthrb, but instead we got a host of bodiless entities that possessed a group of animals, all of which are now running amok! Can you discorporate these beings for us? "
  "We try to be friends with all our animal brethren, but on ~mission_target_planet~ some of the animals have picked up a hostile vibration and are now wreaking havoc. Can you de-tune these creatures? Preferably with a laser? "
  "As trees strive to reach the sun, so animals too are part of a constant struggle for resources and mastery. One animal on planet ~mission_target_planet~ now threatens to dominate the world as we dominate the galaxy. Such an unstable situation should not be permitted to continue. Do you agree?"
  "The playful winds may carry the scent of flowers, or the stench of plague. An epidemic, perhaps spread by a cowardly enemy, has infected animals on planet ~mission_target_planet~. The infected are enraged and turned into predators. Would target practice interest you?"
  "We live in a cosmos filled with incredible violence, from the Big Bang and gamma ray emitters to the single-celled animals that engulf their prey. One animal on planet ~mission_target_planet~ displays courage and aggression bordering on madness. Perhaps they are a threat to security."
 Warrior
  "An infection needs eradication. Is your stomach strong enough to handle the job?"
 Grob
  "We require you to visit planet ~mission_target_planet~ and kill troublesome animals."
  "A cull of useless animals is taking place on planet ~mission_target_planet~. You will participate."
  "You will give us a demonstration of your military capabilities on planet ~mission_target_planet~."

  "Eradicating this species is a task unworthy of us, but it may be suitable for a species such as you. Planet ~mission_target_planet~ is in danger of being overrun by ~mission_target_animal_species~. Their tails glow, so killing them should be ridiculously easy.~p~Kill ~mission_num_kills_needed~ of the dangerous animals. ~group:star_clue~.~p~We will be watching, to make certain you complete this mission quickly and on schedule."
 Grob

  "Our covenant guarantees that our citizens will remain free from want. Yet a plague has removed certain species from the Life Web of our farming planet ~mission_target_planet~ and imperiled production of food. Will you undertake a mission to save the Life Web and keep this food source vital?"
  "A shift of the magnetic poles of planet ~mission_target_planet~ has resulted in a cosmic ray bombardment that has destroyed important links in the planet's Food Web. The Grand Council is doing its best to prevent bio-disaster. Perhaps you can be of service?"

  "During the Autumn Festival, our people go out into the wilderness and eat nuts, berries, and wild animals.

 Shaman
  "Despite our sacrificing flowers to the Volcano Goddess, a massive eruption blocked the sun's rays from planet ~mission_target_planet~, and resulted in the extinction of several species. Now the whole planet is dying! Can you help us restore the balance of nature?"

Terraform Mission briefing 1:
 MySpecies
  "It's starting to get a little cramped down here on the surface.~p~Our success as a species is bringing surprising and unexpected challenges to our own survival. Who woulda thunk it?~p~So, we need you to help us do a little expanding. We'd like you to terraform planet ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ system.~p~Bring planet ~mission_target_planet~ to a Terraform Level of ~mission_terraform_target_score~.~p~It's worth ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks to us, since it's so important."
  "Planet ~mission_target_planet~ seems an ideal settlement if only it had a proper biosphere. Can you give us one?"
  "Planet ~mission_target_planet~ is in need of terraforming. Can you hack it?"
  "We wish to make barren planets bloom. Can you help us?"
 Diplomat
  "We get picked on and bullied on a planetary scale an awful lot. We're growing worried about the long-term survival of our species.~p~We need you to bring planet ~mission_target_planet~, in the ~mission_target_star~ system, to a suitable Terraform level for our habitation - ~mission_terraform_target_score~.~p~After all, the more planets we spread to, the less likely we are to go extinct from a single PBE - Planetary Bullying Event."
  "The Grand Council has assigned a high priority to preparing planets for settlement by our federation. One such likely planet has recently been discovered around star system ~mission_target_star~. Would you be interested in aiding us by terraforming this world?"
  "Our survey of planet ~mission_target_planet~ indicates that it is suitable for terraforming. The Grand Council wishes to settle the planet at once. Can you help us by terraforming planet ~mission_target_planet~?"
  "Planet ~mission_target_planet~ has been deemed suitable for terraforming by the Grand Council. Will you help us with our mission of settlement and civilization?"
 Ecologist
  "As part of our mission to understand the interdependence of all living things, we would like a demonstration of your terraforming capabilities. Would you travel to ~mission_target_star~ and show us your knowledge of eco-metrics?"
  "Planet ~mission_target_planet~ has been judged a suitable candidate for terraforming. Our own terraforming units are engaged elsewhere, but we thought you might be able to accomplish this mission for us. Would you help us expand the galactic life web?"
  "Our mission is to spread life throughout the galaxy. You can help us by terraforming planet ~mission_target_planet~. Would you be interested in this task?"
 Bard
  "Did you know our Empress has the most extensive collection of show-worthy miniature Oogies in this entire arm of the Galaxy? It is true! Are you not impressed?~p~They've outgrown their current kennel-moon, so we'd like you to terraform planet ~mission_target_planet~, in the ~mission_target_star~ system.~p~The Empress' Oogies are very particular, so please make sure you bring the terraform score to level ~mission_terraform_target_score~.~p~These Oogies are a treasure of our Empire, so we'll pay you ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks."
  "We'd like to create a new party planet! It needs balmy breezes, picturesque landscapes, a variety of greenery capable of being turned into delicious beverages, and some interesting animals. Would you like to build it for us? "
  "We've found a worn-out old planet that we'd like to do over! Would you like to demonstrate your decorating skills?"
  "There's nothing wrong with the ~mission_target_star~ system, but it's a boring old collection of planets! We'd like to liven up the neighborhood with a tres chic restyle! Would you like to handle that for us?"
 Zealot
  "It is our task, given to us by Spode himself, that the barren places of the universe be made fruitful. A barren world has been found at star system ~mission_target_star~. Would you be interested in populating it with Spode's glorious creations?"
  "Holy pilgrims stand ready to populate a new world! This planet must be made ready for our species, however... would you render it suitable for Spode's People?"
  "Spode commands us to bring the Light of Spode into all dark places! Unfortunately we can't do this if we can't breathe... could you possibly terraform planet ~mission_target_planet~ for us, so that we can use it as a springboard to bring Spode's Light through the galaxy?"
 Scientist
  "We are interested in discovering as much as possible about the universe, which of course includes our neighbors and their technology. A suitable world has been found at star system ~mission_target_star~. Would you be interested in giving us a demonstration of your abilities? In return for your cooperation, we would offer you suitable rewards."
  "A world has been found that may be suitable for settlement once a proper ecology has been established. Our own terraforming crews are busy on other projects. Would you be interesting in terraforming a world for us?"
  "Planet ~mission_target_planet~ is suitable for terraforming. This is a massive undertaking, and we wonder if ~player_creature_name~ are up to it?"
 Trader
  "Buddy, we got a great project going. Check it:~p~We're growing Designer Consumers for our parent corporation, ObsequiCorp.~p~We need you to terraform planet ~mission_target_planet~, in the ~mission_target_star~ system.~p~If you can bring the planetary Terraform Level to ~mission_terraform_target_score~, we can deposit our Consumer Species on planet ~mission_target_planet~ and start generating profits for ObsequiCorp.~p~And buddy, it's worth ~mission_rewards~ Spucks."
  "All the galaxy stands in awe of your knowledge and power. Perhaps this miserable creature may tempt you to a display of your terraforming prowess at star system ~mission_target_star~. Would you consent to a demonstration in return for magnificent rewards?"
  "A new world beckons, ready to be filled with consumers! But some adjustments to the environment are needed before a settlement can be contemplated. Making such adjustments would be trivial to a being of your magnificence... perhaps you could be tempted with a reward?"
  "Our philosopher Gundrab named the Three Desirables: a gullible customer, a full purse, and a new planet bulging with natural resources ready to be exploited! This exploitation would be made easier if the planet were terraformed first... perhaps, in exchange for a generous commission, you would be willing to perform this task for us?"
 Shaman
  "We're very much interested in the soul of ~player_creature_name~, and there's nothing so revealing of soul than the works of its creation. We've found a barren planet in the ~mission_target_star~ system, and we'd like you to reveal your soul by terraforming it. Would you reveal your soul for us?"
  "Our seers tell us that the world-spirit of the barren ~mission_target_planet~ system yearns for a population to understand and care for it. Perhaps you would like to render it suitable for our settlement?"
  "Planet ~mission_target_planet~ is like a blank canvas waiting the first kiss of the brush! Would you like to be the painter?"
 Warrior
  "The richest and most powerful among us have decided that we've had enough of a bunch of poor and powerless ne'er-do-wells tryin' ta leech offa us like a buncha parasites, so we're getting outta here! Let's see how they like that!~p~Go to planet ~mission_target_planet~. It's in the ~mission_target_star~ system. Bring the terraform score to level ~mission_terraform_target_score~ in preparation for our relocation.~p~We'll pay you ~mission_rewards~ Spucks."
  "If planet ~mission_target_planet~ were terraformed, it would make an excellent forward military base. Would you be willing to contract this work? "
  "We are interested in the concept of non-destructive terraforming. Would you provide us with a demonstration?"
  "Planet ~mission_target_planet~ is suitable for terraforming. We would be interested in discovering whether this is within your capabilities."
 Grob
  "MISSION ASSIGN: Terraform planet ~mission_target_planet~ until it reaches the designated Terraform Target Score.~p~TERRAFORM TARGET SCORE: ~mission_terraform_target_score~.~p~STELLAR SYSTEM: ~mission_target_star~ system.~p~REASONING/OTHER: It knows what it did!~p~PAYMENT: ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.~p~QUERY: Does this assignment hold any interest for you?"
  "Planet ~mission_target_planet~ requires a biosphere. You will supply it."

  "We desire to study the spread of organic life, so that we may prevent it when necessary. You will aid us."

  "I could use a little more detail on how to get there"
  "May I have some directions?"

Destroy Turrets Mission aborted:

  "You're lucky we don't consider this an obstruction of justice!~p~It's one thing to refuse this mission, but to walk away from it in the middle is unacceptable. You're depriving the people of planet ~mission_target_planet~ of the freedom they can't, and haven't, even asked us to provide for them.~p~Shame! Shame on you! SHAME!!! "

War Mission briefing 1:
 MySpecies
  "We're at war with the ~mission_target_empire~! Now is the time to strike! "
  "Captain, now is the time to bring the war to the enemy! Attack ~mission_target_planet~!"
  "It's time to teach the aggressive ~mission_target_empire~ a lesson! "
 Diplomat
  "A fundamental right of all citizens is to be free from violence and fear. Yet the inhabitants of ~mission_target_planet~ have militarized their society and now constitute a threat not only to our civilization, but to the peace of the galaxy.~p~Will you stand with us against this menace?"
  "Another species has killed our peaceful diplomatic mission and attacked our planets. As it is a principle of our civilization to remain free from violence, we are mobilizing against the enemy. In the meantime, however, can you do your part?"
  "The Grand Council desires all species to live in harmony. Nevertheless, another race has attacked our worlds. While we battle them on our home ground, it appears that one of their worlds is undefended. Will you help us bring the war to the enemy?"
 Ecologist
  "Oh, my stars! Please! Help us! We beg of you! The ~mission_target_empire~, won't leave us be! They're threatening to stuff our planet into a gigantic locker if we don't give them our lunch money.~p~We have low blood sugar - we need lunch! Please! You must deal with these bullies! Destroy or capture every city on planet ~mission_target_planet~. It seems drastic, but it's the only way they'll learn."
  "Despite our best efforts to live in peace with our neighbors, we're being attacked by a life-hating civilization. Can you help us defend ourselves from this menace? "
  "A vicious alien race has attacked our civilization! While our forces devote themselves to protecting our fragile planetary balance, can you lead the counter-attack on one of their home worlds?"
  "A peaceful exploration party has been massacred by an alien civilization. Will you help us fight these aggressors?"
 Bard
  "Alas! Is it, perchance, a savior, sent by the very heavens to save us from our wretched destiny?~p~The ~mission_target_empire~ have set all manner of fell beast upon us. Their attacks are merciless! Our people teeter on the precipice!~p~We beseech you with utmost humility: set out for ~mission_target_planet~ and destroy or capture every metropolis you find there. Only then will we be freed from their tyrannical oppression!"
  "We're being attacked by a very tedious species that's interested only in terror and violence. The monotony of it all is driving us mad!~p~Perhaps beings of your vitality and simple martial virtue can be of service to us. What do you say?"
  "If there's anything calculated to ruin a Festival of Visual Delights, it's a bunch of alien warmongers with laser cannons and bombs! We hate to be inhospitable, but they keep blowing up our prettiest things!~p~Can you help us to convince these party-crashers to go home?"
  "Here we were, minding our own business, and suddenly a militarist species appeared in our skies and started lobbing high explosives at us! Could you possibly pop over to one of their worlds and give them a taste of their own medicine?"
 Zealot
  "Another species defies the Way of Spode by refusing our generous offer of conversion! These vile and wretched beings defy us!~p~The Will of Spode demands that these beings be reduced to their constituent atoms! Will you join us in making war on these perverse creatures? "
  "Our efforts to convert a certain world to the Way of Spode has met with unanticipated resistance. Will you help us?"
  "Diabolical forces have tricked the forces of another civilization into declaring war on the Worlds of Spode!  Will you help us crush them?"
  "The Will of Spode demands that these beings be reduced to their constituent atoms! Will you join us in making war on these perverse creatures?"
 Scientist
  "The ~mission_target_empire~ has declared war on us and massacred a scientific research team. This treacherous behavior has caught us by surprise. Would you help us defend ourselves against this menace?"
  "We have been subjected to a vicious raid by the expansionist ~mission_target_empire~. If we fall to the enemy, you'll be next on their list! Can we count on your aid?"
  "The military forces of the ~mission_target_empire~ are fully engaged with our own fleet. This leaves an opportunity for our friends to smash one of their worlds! Will you help us win this decisive victory?"
 Trader
  "Listen, I'm only telling you this 'cause you know I love ya, right? The ~mission_target_empire~ were totally talking smack about you. Terrible things were said, buddy. Your mom was mentioned. More than once.~p~I would never tell you what to do, but if I was you, I'd go straight to ~mission_target_planet~, and I'd destroy or capture every city I saw! This is about the future of the galactic economy!"
  "The ~mission_source_empire~ are a peaceful nation, yet we find ourselves in the position of being attacked by another species! We beg your aid in helping us to defend ourselves from these violent and tyrannical race. Enormous rewards may be anticipated by anyone agreeing to be our friend."
  "Behold the most wretched and unhappy of beings! Our worlds are being attacked by an aggressor species, and it is all we can do to defend ourselves!~p~If our noble and heroic friends, however, were to attack the enemy in their home systems, we would offer them compensation equal to their greatness!"
  "The ~mission_source_empire~ desire only to bring happiness to the galaxy, but those who oppose this noble goal will stop at nothing to prevent us! We are being attacked by another species!~p~We know that this loathsome empire would crumble before your magnificence if you were only to bestir yourselves. Perhaps the offer of rewards would tempt you?"
 Shaman
  "We were explaining the virtues of aura balancing and cleansing to an alien species, and suddenly they began to attack us!~p~Though we deplore violence, we feel that the karmic balance should nevertheless be restored. What do you think?"
  "An alien species is attacking our worlds! We keep sending them peaceful vibrations, but it's not working!~p~Perhaps you can introduce them to the law of equal and opposite reaction? "
  "We keep trying to negotiate with this new species we discovered, but every time we try to talk to them, they start shooting!~p~Perhaps you could show them that there are two sides to this 'shooting' business?"
 Warrior
  "The ~mission_target_empire~ thinks it's soooooo great. Primpin' and preenin' like they own the universe! Dagnabbit! That will not stand!~p~It's about time they was knocked down to size, hmmmm? Tell ya what? Go to ~mission_target_planet~ and lay waste to every city there. We'll make it worth your while for giving those whippersnappers their comeuppance!"
  "The ~mission_target_empire~ has foolishly declared war on us. While we engage and destroy their invading fleets, perhaps it might amuse you to attack their lightly-defended home worlds?"
  "The surest way of killing a snake is to strike at the head. We are at war with the ~mission_target_empire~ and have discovered a lightly defended enemy world. Bring us their heads on a platter!"
  "We are engaged in a victorious war against the ~mission_target_empire~. Would you care to rise in our esteem by helping us to crush them?"

  "Our aesthetic technicians have had a look at the warmongers' planet, and the architecture is unspeakably dreary. If you could fly to ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ system and destroy or capture all the cities, something worthwhile might be built on the ruins.~p~Or not."

  "I'd like to ask you something else..."
  "Before I go, I have other questions..."
  "Also..."
  "One more thing..."
 Response 2
  "The universe is a cold, empty place sometimes."
  "Jeez, you don't have to be testy about it!"
  "You know, words can hurt, too! Words can hurt, too."
  "Are you trying to make me feel guilty? It's not working."
  "I beg your understanding."

War Mission reminder:
 MySpecies
  "You forgot your mission, didn't you? Have you been taking neuropsin suppressors? They are ideal for war-faring species, but they do tend to cloud the mind.~p~The planet of ~mission_target_planet~ is still occupied by the ~mission_target_empire~. Rid ~mission_target_planet~ of these hostile forces. For the Empire!"
  "You haven't destroyed the cities on ~mission_target_planet~! We need this to happen as soon as possible! All necessary information should be in your Mission Log!"
 Diplomat
  "The militarists of ~mission_target_planet~ remain a menace to civilization! Will you help us defeat them? All relevant data should be listed in your Mission Log."
 Ecologist
  "You forgot your mission? It must have been something we did. Please, forgive us! We'll recap:~p~We have suffered cruel bullying at the hands of the ~mission_target_empire~. You have agreed to go to ~mission_target_planet~ and put these bullies on permanent time-out. Destroy or capture every city you find!"
  "The cities of ~mission_target_planet~ are still standing. Our enemies' aggression goes unpunished. Your own Mission Log is witness to the fact that you agreed to help us. Will you complete your mission?"
 Bard
  "The ~mission_target_planet~ is still invaded by the ~mission_target_empire~. Get them out of that planet."
  "We hate to remind you, but you said you'd go to ~mission_target_planet~ and estroy-day the ities-say. Consult your Mission Log if you think we're lying! When can we expect some aesthetically-satisfying eruptions of debris?"
 Zealot
  "Did you not swear to crush the enemies of Spode at ~mission_target_planet~. Yet their cities still stand! Your Mission Log bears witness to your promise! Will you act in accordance with your oath before Spode?"
 Scientist
  "Our scans indicate that the enemy still resists at ~mission_target_planet~. Has your Mission Log not received the commission? Will you destroy or capture their cities?"
 Trader
  "You forgot the mission? I know how it goes. It's tough when a whole species talks bad about your mom. It just gets you so angry, you forget the little stuff. It's okay.~p~You need to go to ~mission_target_planet~ and get rid of the ~mission_target_empire~. For the things they said. About your mom."
  "We express astonishment that beings of your puissance have failed to destroy or capture the cities of ~mission_target_planet~. Our contract is recorded in your Mission Log! Will you crush our enemies as you promised?"
 Shaman
  "You haven't finished letting the flowers bloom on ~mission_target_planet~! Will you finish your mission? Check your Mission Log if you're uncertain about the details."
 Warrior
  "What! It's you? Listen here, bub! The people we hire, they don't stay hired if'n they keep forgetting what it is they're supposed to be doing! Sheesh! It's been so long, I'm a little hazy on the specifics, myself. I know I wanted you to go to planet ~mission_target_planet~ and rid it of the ~mission_target_empire~. I can't 'member why - just do it!"
  "Cities still stand on ~mission_target_planet~. Your orders are in your Mission Log. Why have you not carried them out?"
 Grob
  "MISSION STATUS: Incomplete.~p~MISSION TARGET: ~mission_target_planet~~p~MISSION GOAL: Eliminate the ~mission_target_empire~ from the planet."
  "We are informed that you have failed to destroy cities on ~mission_target_planet~, despite our downloading all necessary information into your Mission Log. Do you intend to obey orders?"
 Response 1
  "I'd like to ask you something else..."
  "Before I go, I have other questions..."
  "Let's talk about something else."
  "Let's take this further..."
 Response 2
  "My conscience can't bear this. I give up."
  "This is too horrific. I quit."
  "I just can't do it. Find someone else."
  "I give up. Sorry."
 Response 3
  "That's right. Bring them to heel."
  "I remember now. Make with the boom boom."
  "Ahh, yes. Global Annihilation. Got it."
  "Aha! Destroy or capture them! That's the part I forgot."

War Mission aborted:
 MySpecies
  "I can't say your actions will aid your reputation, but I can't say I blame you, either. Intergalactic extermination is a tricky business, fraught with all sorts of knotty ethical dilemmas."
  "You can't give up! This is a matter of survival!"
 Diplomat
  "I will report to the Grand Council that your behavior has taken a sinister turn. Goodbye."
 Ecologist
  "You're... quitting?~p~*Gulp*~p~Oh, this makes things much worse! Much, much worse.~p~Not that it's your fault! We meant no offense!"
  "Are you in league with our enemies?"
 Bard
  "Though 'tis us that shall bear the mighty onslaught of the ravening hordes of the ~mission_target_empire~, you shall wither under the poison pen of our of slighted poets - we shall curse you with a trillion sonnets. You forget - we have your email address!"
  "This really wasn't the best time for one of your little jokes."
 Zealot
  "Beware Spode's vengeance for this oath-breaking and treachery."
 Scientist
  "Available data suggests that you are not long for this galaxy."
 Trader
  "Oooh! I can not believe what I am hearing! You don't start an interplanetary cleansing program and just quit mid-way. It makes everyone look bad. People misunderstand, they hold grudges. You know?"
  "No rewards! No bazaar! You are a willful and treacherous species!"
 Shaman
  "And people say that we're inconsistent!"
 Warrior
  "Bah! What good're ya, anyways? There's one thing and one thing only that we can count on you for: disappointment!~p~Nothing worse than a weak-willed mercenary. Get outta our sight!"
  "Timing is everything with a stab in the back, and you have missed your stroke."
 Grob
  "MISSION STATUS: Terminated by Contractor.~p~FEELINGS: Betrayal, disappointment...~p~IRRELEVANT!~p~IRRELEVANT!~p~TRANSMISSION ENDED."

 Response 1
  "I'd like to ask you something else..."
  "Before I go, I have other questions."
  "I'm sorry. But I would like to ask something else..."
  "One more thing..."
 Response 2
  "Why can't we all just get along?"
  "You're going to have to find another way. War sucks!"
  "Tough oogies. I'm done with this."
  "In time, your anger will subside."
  "I beg your understanding."

War Mission failed:
 MySpecies
  "You failed to destroy or capture them on time. Pity."
  "What a horrific defeat! How can we beat the ~mission_target_empire~ now? "
 Diplomat
  "The Grand Council is alarmed at the strength of the enemy. In compensation for the damaged you have sustained, I am authorized to offer you a Certificate of Commendation, Second Class."
 Ecologist
  "Thank you for doing what you could. This wretched, destructive war will go on"
 Bard
  "But we had such confidence in your invincibility! Maybe another time..."
 Zealot
  "Alas that you were defeated by the heathen! Spode shall wreak vengeance in his own time."
 Scientist
  "Analysis of the battle demonstrates the strength of the enemy defenses. Examination of the data surrounding your wretched failure may point the way to future success."
 Trader
  "We are both of us weak and wretched species! We shall go into mourning for both our races.~p~But first, perhaps, you will wish to visit our boutique."
 Shaman
  "We're sorry to see that you failed. Unfortunately this terrible war will go on."
 Warrior
  "Our tacticians have learned from your failure. That's the best thing that can be said."
 Grob
  "Your tactics were inadequate. We shall complete destruction of the ~mission_target_empire~ ourselves."
 Response 1
  "Let's talk about something else."
  "I just need more time to do the job right."
 Response 2
  "Sorry."
  "This wasn't worth the risk, anyway."

War Mission complete:
 MySpecies
  "You have performed this grave task unflinchingly. For that, we salute you. Thank you for your tireless service. Here is ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, for any hardships you may have endured in the course of this assignment."
  "Congratulations on your stirring victory, Captain! We'll build you a statue as soon as the budget permits, but in the meantime have these ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks."
 Diplomat
  "The war for civilization has been brought to a triumphant conclusion. The Grand Council is pleased to award you the Certificate of Commendation, First Class, and ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks."
 Ecologist
  "Oh, my. We just don't know what to say. You've spared us from terrible humiliation, and removed a grave threat from the galaxy as well, no doubt. We don't know how we can repay you.~p~Oh, wait. Yes, we do - the specified amount: ~mission_rewards~ Spucks."
  "Thank you for helping us defeat our enemies. Please take ~mission_rewards~ Spucks. Now the task of rebuilding their ecosphere can begin."
 Bard
  "Ho! Who goes there?~p~Ahh, our great hero returns, borne on the blessed wings of victory, no less!~p~Shhhh! Listen! Can you hear it? It's the sound of a million quills taking to parchment, singing your praises in prose! The ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks reward must seem so paltry in comparison."
  "There is a certain pleasure in contemplating the stern majesty of ruins, especially when they belong to another species. Have ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, and maybe we can blow up a planet together some time!"
 Zealot
  "The enemies of Spode are dust on the solar wind! May you enjoy your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks and the blessings of Spode. Please take a free copy of our scriptures with you as you leave."
 Scientist
  "The aggressors have been crushed, and much useful data has been harvested about their capabilities... and yours. Enjoy your ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, and our thanks."
 Trader
  "Heeey, buddy! Is the ~mission_target_empire~ gone from ~mission_target_planet~? Yes? That's just super-awesome! What they said was just rude, regardless of the mom in question, right? My mom, your mom. What's important is justice was served. Here is what we promised: ~mission_rewards~ Spucks."
  "We go to dance in the ashes of destroyed enemy cities - but not before giving you ~mission_rewards~ Spucks and allowing you to visit our emporium."
 Shaman
  "You've done quite well, though of course we realize that you are a victim as well. We hope any post-traumatic stress may be alleviated by the ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks."
 Warrior
  "Ha! We're almost proud of ya. The ~mission_target_empire~ got what was comin' to them... ~mission_target_planet~ is now ours for the taking, thanks to you! Now, there's the little matter of your reward: ~mission_rewards~ Spucks. Don't say we never gave you nothin'."
  "The enemy have been consigned to the flames. We honor you for your actions in a war that was not entirely your own, and we offer you ~mission_rewards~ Spucks."
 Grob
  "MISSION STATUS: Success.~p~SUMMARY: ~mission_target_empire~ has been downsized from ~mission_target_planet~.~p~PAYMENT: ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks.~p~NOTES: Clerical error detected. Wrong empire targeted. Don't tell the supervisor."
  "Your military capabilities are noted. Take ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks."
 Response 1
  "Thanks. Now let's discuss something more..."
  "Next on the agenda..."
  "Let's talk about something else."
  "Let's take this further..."
 Response 2
  "I've been cleansing, yet I feel dirty. Such rich irony. I'll take a break."
  "I had fun. Call me anytime."
  "Nothing satisfies at the end of the day like global destruction."
  "That's tiring work. I could use a rest. Bye!"
  "Thank you. Now, please excuse me. I must be going.."
