  "A delightful new world has been discovered at ~mission_target_star~! In order to determine which of our vast industrial cartels may best plunder its resources, a planetary survey is necessary. Can you bestir your greatness in order to help us, in exchange of course for considerable reward?"
  "Oh, I am a wretched being! The world of ~mission_target_planet~ requires a survey, but I have no surveyors! Instead, all I have is money lying around in heaps! ~p~Perhaps a solution may occur to your vast intelligence?"
  "Happily we do the Dance of Acquirement! The real estate market at ~mission_target_planet~ is ready to zoom for the stratosphere! All that is required is a survey, so that we can best determine where to place our settlements. ~p~Perhaps your great mind can be put to this matter, if we make it worth your while?"
 Shaman
  "We've found a new world full of life! In order to discover if anything on this world can be used as props in our ceremonies, we need a full survey. Could you possibly do a survey for us?"
  "The aura of ~mission_target_planet~ sparkles with life, but we don't know what kind. There could be something there that could aid our spiritual growth! Could you travel there and do a survey? "
  "The Ascended Master Phrax, channeled by one of our seers, informs us that ~mission_target_planet~ may contain an object that will help us vibrate at a higher frequency! Could you possibly survey this world for us?"
 Warrior
  "~mission_target_planet~ has been placed within our security zone, but the world has not yet had a complete survey. Would you be willing to help us?"
  "Our recon teams are committed to a long-term project elsewhere, just as we need a survey of ~mission_target_planet~. Will you survey the world for us?"
  "~mission_target_planet~ needs a thorough survey to make certain that our settlers have no unpleasant surprises waiting for them. Would you be willing to make such a survey?"

 Zealot
  "Spode be praised! Your scans show that the planet holds a supply of ~mission_item~. In accordance with the Forty-First Prophecy of Spode, ~mission_item~ must be brought to this, our own world. Will you perform for us this holy task?"
  "You have located for us ~mission_item~, which some believe to be the 'arthngleb' referred to in Spode's Forty-First Prophecy! A supply must be brought here at once! Will you take this blessing unto yourself?"

  "Well, this is a bit of a disappointment. We had hoped we could entice you. ~p~This mission may seem ordinary, but it's potentially *extremely* important to our species. ~p~It's a shame we'll have to put the job in less capable hands."
 Diplomat
  "We will not insist. Goodbye. "
 Ecologist
  "We'll manage the scans ourselves then."
 Bard
  "Not interested? Not even a little bit? Oh well."
 Zealot
  "Obviously it is not for infidels such as yourselves to further Spode's Grand Design."
 Scientist
  "If you insist. Goodbye. "
 Trader
  "We'll have to keep all the money for ourselves then. "

 Ecologist
  "That's unfortunate. We'll manage the work ourselves then, sooner or later."
 Bard
  "But you've been our perfect tool so far!"
 Zealot
  "Surely Spode has not entered into your heart!"
 Scientist
  "In that case, we shall manage this matter ourselves."
 Trader
  "Not even the prospect of a great reward tempts you? You are unique in the galaxy!"

 Bard
  "We're trying not to be impatient, but we notice you haven't returned with your scans from ~mission_target_planet~. Look in your Mission Log if it's somehow slipped your mind. "
 Zealot
  "You haven't provided the scans from ~mission_target_planet~. All necessary information should be in your Mission Log! Spode's Grand Design must not be delayed!"
 Scientist
  "We were hoping to analyze the scans from ~mission_target_planet~. What went wrong? Have you clumsily deleted them from your Mission Log?"
 Trader
  "Where are our glorious profits? You haven't provided the scans from ~mission_target_planet~. All necessary information should be in your Mission Log! "
 Shaman
  "After all our chanting, you still haven't got the scans from ~mission_target_planet~. Could you check your Mission Log for the details and head straight there? "
 Warrior

 Trader
  "Here we are standing on all these great stacks of Sporebucks and you haven't brought the ~mission_item~?"
 Shaman
  "We're all for people hanging loose and doing their own thing, but didn't you tell us you'd bring us some ~mission_item~? Our clairvoyants say that the information is in your Mission Log."
 Warrior

Fetch Commodity Mission briefing:
 MySpecies
  "We have recently learned of a granular, powdery substance known as ~mission_item~ that has many strange and useful properties. ~p~Our intel tells us that there is a highly purified sample of ~mission_item~ on planet ~mission_target_planet~. ~p~We need you to locate that sample and acquire it. You are authorized to use whatever means you feel is appropriate to the mission."
  "~mission_item~ has become vital to our economy. Can you bring us some?"

 Diplomat
  "The Grand Council wants nothing but the happiness and prosperity of its citizens. In order that our citizens continue to flourish, we would like to assure an adequate supply of ~mission_item~. Would you be willing to procure this item for us?"
  "A supply of ~mission_item~ is necessary in order to fulfill the ambitious architectural plan for the Grand Council Hall. Would you help us obtain a sufficient supply?"
  "In its latest Plan of Development, the Grand Council has designated ~mission_item~ as a Class A Substance. Due to a shortfall, we may be in danger of falling short of our quota! Would you obtain us a supply of ~mission_item~?"
 Ecologist
  "Our hanging gardens are receiving a lot of galactic tourism attention lately and it's causing a bit of leaf curl. We need you to get some ~mission_item~ from planet ~mission_target_planet~ for us. This will perk up our leaves."
  "~mission_item~ is a necessary component of our pollution-free energy web, but a recent shipment was hijacked by pirates. Would you bring some of this to us so that our world can maintain its pristine splendor? "
  "Small quantities of ~mission_item~ have proven useful in restoring areas that have been subject to deforestation. Is it possible for you to bring us some?"
  "We have discovered that ~mission_item~ has properties that boost our species' immune systems. Would you bring us some of this valuable item?"
 Bard
  "Perchance, have you had the privilege of supping on comestibles prepared with a dash of ~mission_item~? It's like a thousand angels ascending heavenwards, right in your mouth! ~p~We've located a generous cache of ~mission_item~ on planet ~mission_target_planet~. We must possess it at all cost! ~p~Our chefs are the finest in the Galaxy! For such a rare commodity to be in lesser kitchens is a travesty our mouths can no longer endure."
  "Our increasingly-frenetic parties are fueled by quantities of ~mission_item~, but we seem to be running low. Will you bring us some so that the revels may continue? "
  "We've found that putting ~mission_item~ in the water supply increases health and well-being. Or at least the illusion of health and well-being, and since all we care about is appearance, that's all that matters. We're running short... Can you bring us some?"
  "The latest fashion is for ~mission_item~ to be formed into flower vases worn on the head, but demand is exceeding the supply. Could you bring us some, so that more of us can dress a la mode?"
 Zealot
  "The worship of Spode requires a supply of certain sacred items. A thorough search through all Spode's temples has revealed a startling shortage of ~mission_item~. Would you obtain some for us?"
  "Our theologian-healers use ~mission_item~ in order to heal Spode's faithful, but unfortunately our supplies are running low. Can you bring us some?"
  "~mission_item~ is found on a properly-equipped altar, but Spode's faithful are having difficulty procuring this necessary item. Can you help us with our worship?"
 Scientist
  "Our economic trend analyses failed to predict an up-tick in the use of ~mission_item~. Would you be willing to bring us a supply?"
  "The trade in ~mission_item~ is a vital element in our interstellar trade network. Is it possible for you to travel to a neighboring world and procure us a supply?"
  "A pirate raid has destroyed a freighter bringing us a supply of ~mission_item~. Would you be willing to help us make up the shortfall?"
 Trader
  "Do you yearn to mingle with the wealthy and influential? ~p~Then have we got a mission a for you! You betcha! ~p~This mission is guaranteed to get your face in the news! Interested? I'm glad you asked: ~p~This mission involves the legendary ~mission_item~ spice! Recent patent rule changes affecting planet ~mission_target_planet~ mean that...~p~Hey buddy! Do we have your attention? Thought so. Would you like to learn more?"
  "Though we can scarcely imagine that a being of your puissance would be interested in our paltry problems, we observe that our markets are short of ~mission_item~. If it wouldn't be too much trouble, could you bring us some in exchange for rewards worthy of your splendor? "
  "Our joyful species is growing in misery, and all for lack of ~mission_item~. May this wretched one offer you compensation in return for bringing us a supply?"
  "Pirates have hijacked our shipment of ~mission_item~. Might we trouble your majestic selves to bring us another supply?"
 Shaman
  "Teacher Nk discovered that splashing ~mission_item~ on our eyeballs increases second sight, but we seem to be running out. Can you bring us more? "
  "~mission_item~ is used to purify worshipers during the Ceremony of Self-Congratulation, where we praise ourselves for being as spiritually advanced as we are. But ~mission_item~ is in short supply due to all the praise we've worked so hard to earn, and we wonder if you'd bring us a supply?"

  "You appear to be suffering from some short-term memory loss.

  "We're still waiting for ~mission_item~! You should be able to find the details in your Mission Log."

 Trader
  "Oh? Have you become confused over something? ~p~That's thoroughly understandable - this is a very complex mission involving the wrangling of exotic and cunning flora. ~p~Here's a recap: ~p~Go to the ~mission_target_star~ system and locate planet ~mission_target_planet~. There, you will find the ~mission_item~ plant. Bring us a sample. ~p~Hmm, now that I say that out loud, it doesn't sound very complex, after all."
  "What happened to the ~mission_item~ from the ~mission_target_star~ system? We've borrowed heavily for the processing plant, and wish the profits to start flowing immediately. All details of the agreement should be found in your Mission Log. "

Fetch Tribe Citizen Mission briefing 1:
 MySpecies
  "A passing trader told us of a tribal species on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Maybe they'd be our allies if we helped them out! "
  "It's possible that the dominant species on planet ~mission_target_planet~ may possess intelligence. Will you help us find out?"
  "A trader showed us some primitive tools that came from planet ~mission_target_planet~. We'd like to find out more about this world."
 Diplomat
  "It is a mission of our federation to discover intelligent life forms and raise them to the level of our own civilization. Would you aid us in this endeavor?"
  "A probe has recently returned from planet ~mission_target_planet~ with evidence that a species there may have developed intelligent life. As our covenant clearly expresses a desire to bring all intelligent species under the protection of the Grand Council, we would like to find out more about these beings before approaching them formally. Can you investigate for us?"
  "Our federation desires uplift and education for all intelligent species. A new intelligent species may have been discovered at planet ~mission_target_planet~. Could you help us find out more about them?"
 Ecologist
  "The galaxy has shown us another one of its wonders. A new species has risen from the fertile ecosystem of planet ~mission_target_planet~, and we suspect this species possesses intelligence. Will you bring us one of these creatures so that we may study its place in the cosmic order?"
  "Intelligent life is the capstone of the galactic life web. A probe to planet ~mission_target_planet~ has shown what may be the beginnings of a tribal society. Can you help us investigate the nature of this new species?"
  "A new species seems to have risen from the fertile muck of planet ~mission_target_planet~. We have yet to determine this species' capabilities. Would you help us?"
 Bard
  "Planet ~mission_target_planet~ seems to have sheltered a new intelligent species! We'd very much like to acquire one of these beings, teach it some songs and find out whether they'd make good pets. Will you bring us one? "
  "A new form of intelligent life may have arisen on planet ~mission_target_planet~. We're all mesmerized by the tribal lifestyle, with all the drums and maracas and nose-flutes and dancing. Can you bring one of these people here, so that we can enjoy the fascination of the primitive up close?"
  "A new race has risen from the slime of planet ~mission_target_planet~! Since we're always looking for new people to party with, maybe you can fetch one of these beings in time for our next soiree. What do you think?"
 Zealot
  "Spode has filled the universe with wonders for us to discover. On a nearby star system we have found a being that may have developed intelligence. We would like to study these creatures in order to determine whether they are ready for the Way of Spode. Would you bring us a sample? "
  "Spode has granted a new species the gift of intelligence! We wish to examine a member of this species to determine whether or not these newcomers are ready for the Word of Spode. Will you help us?"
  "Praise Spode! The creatures of planet ~mission_target_planet~ may have developed sufficient intelligence to comprehend our theology! Will you help us discover if they are ready for Spode's Eternal Light?"
 Scientist
  "A wandering trader recently sold us some artifacts that she claims came from an undiscovered intelligent species. We are skeptical, but our xeno-anthropologists would very much like to analyze any new sentient species, if it exists. Would you be willing to help us verify the existence of this species? "
  "One of our probes to planet ~mission_target_planet~ was destroyed shortly after landing by natives armed with rocks and sticks. Are you willing to help us find out more about this new species?"
  "One of our ships transiting star system ~mission_target_star~ chanced to observe evidence of a primitive species living on one of its worlds. Would you help discover if this species possesses intelligence?"
 Trader
  "We've discovered the home world of a new intelligent species! Would it be too much trouble for a being of your magnificence to pop over to star system ~mission_target_star~ and fetch one of these primitive creatures? We will make it worth your time. "
  "Good news! Our stock is rising because we have discovered a potential new market! A species in the ~mission_target_star~ system is believed to have developed intelligence! ~p~Surely a being of your experience would know how to bring us one of these creatures, in exchange for rewards?"
  "On an insignificant planet in the ~mission_target_star~ system, nature has worked one of its wonders! A creature there has evolved into a species of intelligence that needs to learn about our products! Will you help us prepare our Ad campaign? Rich rewards are a certainty"
 Shaman
  "Planet ~mission_target_planet~ seems to be the home of a tribal species. We're fascinated to discover if these beings have any exciting, primitive ceremonies we can adapt. Will you bring us one so we can ask it to dance for us?"
  "Some of us yearn to forsake the material life by living in grass huts, hunting and gathering, and shaking maracas. Unfortunately, we don't have anyone to teach us the necessary skills, so we wonder if you can fetch us one of the tribal people from planet ~mission_target_planet~ to be our teacher?"
  "We admire the profound spiritual simplicity of those who live close to nature. As a tribal people live on planet ~mission_target_planet~, we'd like to adopt one of these as our teacher. Will you visit this world and bring us a suitable candidate?"
 Warrior
  "We've discovered that a species on planet ~mission_target_planet~ has developed intelligence. These might make useful mercenaries. Can you help us evaluate them?"
  "A new species on planet ~mission_target_planet~ should be evaluated to discover if they pose a potential threat. Are you interested in helping us?"
  "Planet ~mission_target_planet~ turns out to possess a primitive species. We might want to brush them aside and take their world for our own, but they may prove tenacious. Can you conduct a reconnaissance for us?"

  "An intelligent organic species has been discovered on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Bring us one for evaluation. "

  "The ~race~ have initiated a massive ecological undertaking and we need your help. ~p~We're building large arcologies for some of the more promising planetary ecosystems as a safeguard against unanticipated extinction level events. You know - asteroid strikes, solar flares, that sort of thing. ~p~We need you to find planet ~mission_target_planet~ and gather samples - one of each - of all planetary life."
  "We have recently discovered that planet ~mission_target_planet~ is full of life. In order to find out if we can place a settlement, we need to collect samples of life forms. Will you do this?"
  "Planet ~mission_target_planet~ turns out to have a viable biosphere. Can you give us a survey?"
  "We want to plant a settlement on planet ~mission_target_planet~, but we want to make certain there are no unpleasant surprises. Can you perform an inspection?"
 Diplomat
  "An automated survey has recently informed the Grand Council about a world that might be suitable for habitation. In order to discover whether the world is suitable for settlement, a full survey of plants and animals must be made by our scientists at the Unity Institute. Would you be willing to aid them?"
  "The Grand Council has decreed that a survey of planet ~mission_target_planet~ take place at once, but all our survey vessels are committed elsewhere. Will you help us?"
  "One of our survey ships was recently attacked by pirates and the data from the survey of planet ~mission_target_planet~ was lost. Can you conduct a new survey on our behalf?"
 Ecologist
  "A complete ecosystem has recently been discovered on planet ~mission_target_planet~. These new species might prove a valuable addition to our storehouse of natural wonders. We would like to survey this world in order to determine if any of these species would be harmful, or whether they would be a useful addition to our Life Web. ~p~Would you complete a survey for us? "
  "Planet ~mission_target_planet~ has long been scheduled for a full survey, but our corps of ecologists is fully engaged in turning our inhabited worlds into garden spots. Can you complete the survey on our behalf?"
  "The ecosystem of planet ~mission_target_planet~ seems to include several unique features. Could you survey the planet and report to us?"
 Bard
  "The ~race~ are incomparable gourmands, known for our refined palate and exquisite culinary skills, and we have learned of the holy grail of haute cuisine - planetary bouillabaisse! ~p~Planet ~mission_target_planet~ houses the perfect mixture of fauna and flora. It's as if the planet evolved towards a common goal of deliciousness! ~p~You must find this planet, and return here with a sampling of all life - one of each. Then, we shall have a most sumptuous meal!"
  "We've found a promising new planet! Planet ~mission_target_planet~ is chock-full of interesting new organisms that may prove useful as ornaments or pets. Would you be a pet and go do a survey? "
  "Planet ~mission_target_planet~ is teeming with life, but is it interesting life or tedious life? We'd like you to bring us some, and then we'll decide."
  "We're thinking of moving to planet ~mission_target_planet~, trading the endless ennui of parties and festivals for the bracing vigor of exploration and the tonic of an alien ecosystem. But can we even live there? We can't tell without a survey. ~p~Would you pop over to planet ~mission_target_planet~ and conduct one for us?"
  "When we settled this world, we made a point of pruning away all the dull or ugly plants and animals. Apparently we went too far... now the whole ecosystem is on the verge of collapse! Can you help us?"
  "Planet ~mission_target_planet~ is in dire need of a makeover. Can you help us reseed and reshape? "
  "Oops! When we woke up after the last party, we found that we'd killed and eaten the last members of several delicious species. Would you be interested in helping us restock?"
 Zealot
  "The Ways of Spode are many and various. A world has been discovered that is rich in organisms, and which may serve as a settlement through which the Light of Spode may be projected throughout the galaxy. ~p~Would you aid us in this sacred cause?"
  "Praise Spode! A whole new world has been discovered full of Spode's handiwork! Will you help us investigate this new creation?"
  "Firm in the faith, our pilgrims ready themselves to pioneer a newly-discovered world! But we lack sufficient information concerning what species await us. Will you help us investigate Spode's handiwork on this new world? "
 Scientist
  "One of our probes has discovered a new world, planet ~mission_target_planet~, that may be suitable for settlement. However, a complete survey has yet to be undertaken. ~p~Would you be willing to aid us in this matter?"
  "A pirate attack has destroyed the vessel returning from the survey of planet ~mission_target_planet~. Preliminary data suggests that the world has a most interesting biome. Would you be willing to complete the survey on our behalf?"
  "Someone in the Department of Records apparently filed the survey of planet ~mission_target_planet~ using the wrong 26-digit number, and now we can't find any of the data. This is extremely vexing, as we had hoped to be able to place a settlement there. Would you be willing to do a quick survey for us?"
 Trader
  "It happened again! Pranksters! A group of juvenile delinquents from a neighboring system have been wreaking havoc with our biome. The plants and animals have been repeatedly tagged, TP'd, egged, wedgied and wet-willied, and they're beginning to look a bit shabby. So we're going to spruce the place up a bit with a few new species.~p~We need you to find planet ~mission_target_planet~ and bring us a sampling of its inhabitants. One of each."
  "One of our trade missions recently passed by a world that might be useful for settlement. Unfortunately the mission needed to travel elsewhere to unload a surplus of consumer items and had no chance to survey the planet. ~p~A being of your splendor surely would have no difficulty in conducting a survey of planets and animals. May we tempt you with a suitable reward? "
  "Planet ~mission_target_planet~ may be suitable for setting up a trade mission! But before we settle the world, a survey needs to be conducted. For a being of your magnificence, this should be a trivial matter... and of course, we offer rewards."
  "We have discovered a new world that may be suitable for exploitation by our industrial cartels! A survey of its natural resources needs to be conducted first, so we know which industries will be suitable. Perhaps we could tempt you to conduct such a survey if the rewards are suitable?"
 Shaman
  "We've discovered a new world at ~mission_target_star~. One of our crack psychics dreamed that one of the life-forms on this world will help us to form ectoplasm. Would you help us with this discovery?"
  "We've discovered a brand new world, pristine in its splendor! We need to determine whether it will be a proper sanctuary for aura balancers, crystal gazers, card readers, mediums, telephone sanitizers, or all of the above! Will you help us with a survey?"
  "Out of the One come the Many, and out of the Many come the Many More, but yet all remain One, save for those which are not firm in their Oneness! Among the Many More is a newly discovered planet, planet ~mission_target_planet~. We don't know whether it's part of the One or the Not-Oneness, and for that we need a survey. Would you oblige us? "
 Warrior
  "Would ya look at this miserable heap we've been calling home! We're sick of it! All of it! Everything! The whole ecosystem! ~p~We've been far too forgiving of our plants and animals for far too long. It's time for them to go! ~p~We need you to find planet ~mission_target_planet~ and gather up one of each of it's plant and animal species. We're gonna swap 'em in for the sorry waste of DNA currently wastin' space on this rock. Perhaps this new lot will amuse us."
  "Our recon teams are busy performing reconnaissance elsewhere, and are unable to complete a proper survey of planet ~mission_target_planet~. Are you willing to stand in for them?"
  "We intend to settle planet ~mission_target_planet~, but the world first requires a survey. Would you be willing to aid us?"
  "Our fleet is elsewhere right now, on maneuvers intended to intimidate our neighbors. In the meantime planet ~mission_target_planet~ needs a survey. Are you interested? "
 Grob
  "FIRST OBJECTIVE: Find planet ~mission_target_planet~. ~p~SECOND OBJECTIVE: Collect samples of all flora and fauna. Return here. ~p~REASONING/OTHER: They know what they did! ~p~PAYMENT: ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks."
  "It is necessary to survey plants and animals on planet ~mission_target_planet~. You will accomplish this. "
  "Planet ~mission_target_planet~ requires an inventory of all plants and animals. You have nothing better to do."
  "Our study of ecocide requires further specimens. You will provide these."

  "You got it. Let's get started."
  "Okay. Let's do this thing!"
 Response 2
  "This mission is not for me."
  "I'm not interested in doing this."
  "You should find someone else for this job."
  "No, I can't help you with this."

Multi Delivery Mission accepted:
 MySpecies
  "Great! We know you'll do a fine job!"
 Diplomat
  "The Grand Council of the Federation thanks you. Please hurry."
 Ecologist
  "You're totally making the Universe a better place... Thank you."
 Bard
  "How fantastic! I'd sing you a song, if only it wouldn't delay your start!"
 Zealot
  "Let Spode's will be done! You may begin at once!"
 Scientist
  "Excellent. Your assistance is strengthening our hypothesis on ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~ behavior."
 Trader
  "Wonderful! I knew we had the right ~player_creature_name~ for the job."
 Shaman
  "We thank you for your assistance!"
 Warrior
  "Good. We ~race~ are pleased by your assistance."
 Grob

  "I'd like to ask you something else..."
  "Before I go, I have other questions..."
  "Also..."
  "One more thing..."
 Response 2
  "I should be off. Farewell!"
  "Thank you for the opportunity. I'm heading out now."
  "I will return shortly. So long for now."
  "It's time to start. I'll see you when I return."

Multi Delivery Mission rejected:
 MySpecies
  "That's unfortunate. We would have liked to work with you on this. Perhaps some other time."
 Diplomat
  "Very well. Please do not let us detain you from your many more important tasks."
 Ecologist
  "Oooh... okay. Yes, that's okay.~p~If your heart is not in it, we wouldn't want you interacting with another life form."
 Bard
  "But... but... but... but... but... but... but... but... ~p~Okay."
 Zealot
  "The Way of Spode is apparently not for ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. You may leave us."
 Scientist
  "Interesting choice ~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. Perhaps you have some information we do not, although that seems unlikely."
 Trader
  "Of course, of course. I knew it was hopeless to bring such a trivial matter to so glorious a one as yourself. Perhaps you could console me by spending money in the boutique?"
 Shaman
  "You must follow your own path.~p~Be well my friend."
 Warrior
  "No? ~player_creature_name~ is weaker than expected. Next time, maybe we should not offer reward. We do not pay weaklings."
 Grob
  "MISSION DECLINED. REASON: ~player_creature_name~ is an inferior species."
 Response 1
  "Wait. One more thing."
  "I just had one more thing to ask..."
  "I have one more question."
  "Can I ask you something?"
 Response 2
  "Okay. I'm off."
  "Well, bye."
  "Sorry that I couldn't help. Good-bye."
  "I beg your understanding."

Multi Delivery Mission - Player greets recipient without item:
 MySpecies
  "Small galaxy, ay Captain. What a coincidence that YOU were asked to bring us the ~mission_multi_delivery_buyer_num_needed_items~ ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts.~p~I suppose Sporebucks is Sporebucks. We'll see you again when you locate the items."
 Diplomat
  "Oh yes. I am remembering something about this in the last transmission of paperwork for the Main Distribution Center. We were expecting someone with ~mission_multi_delivery_item~ artifacts. You don't have any. Not to point any fingers, but the problem is not on our side, you know?"
 Ecologist
  "Who did you say you were? ~player_creature_name~? Hmm... wait... it's coming to me.... ~mission_source_empire~ sent you yes?

 Scientist
  "~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. I see you have decided it would be most efficient to verify your delivery location before indentifying the objects of delivery. Interesting.

Eradicate Animals Mission briefing 1:
 MySpecies
  "Plague-ridden animals are attacking our settlement on  planet ~mission_target_planet~! We need your help!"
  "A carnivorous animal species is attacking on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Can you aid us?"
  "A harmless virus on planet ~mission_target_planet~ has mutated into a threat to wildlife. Will you give us help?"
 Diplomat
  "In order that the inhabitants of planet ~mission_target_planet~ be secure, they must be made safe from predatory life-forms. Would you be willing to undertake a mission to eradicate the carnivorous ~mission_target_animal_species~ from planet ~mission_target_planet~?"
  " The Grand Council guarantees that our citizens shall live free from fear. A sub-contractor surveying planet ~mission_target_planet~ prior to settlement failed to notice that the herbivores known as ~mission_target_animal_species~ were about to enter a carnivorous cycle. The Grand Council would be pleased if you were to aid in eradicating planet ~mission_target_planet~ of this menace."
 Ecologist
  "Oh, we're so lucky you came along! We have an urgent task, but we don't have the heart to carry it out ourselves. It's too awful!~p~It's the adorable ~mission_target_animal_species~ species! ~mission_num_kills_needed~ of them have come down with the dreaded Oogie Fever! If it spreads, it'll wipe them all out!~p~The infected animals must be... *gulp*... eradicated.~p~We'll pay you! ~mission_rewards~ Spucks. Sound good?"
  "A plague has spread among the animals of planet ~mission_target_planet~. This threatens to unhinge the planet's entire ecology! Can you help us avert disaster by eradicating the infected animals!"
  "Illegal gene-hackers have altered the DNA of one of the animals on planet ~mission_target_planet~, and it has now become a menace to other animals and even to our citizens! Can you help us?"
  "While we try to be at one with Nature, sometimes Nature's method of being at one with us involves having us for dinner. Such is the case on ~mission_target_planet~, where a mutation has turned one of the animals belligerent. We shrink from bloodshed, so will you take the necessary action?"
 Bard
  "You want something to do? Why, sure. We got something that'll get rid of you. I mean, we have a task.~p~Why don't you... oh, I don't know... let's say... kill ~mission_num_kills_needed~ specific ~mission_target_animal_species~ ~^p^mission_num_kills_needed^creature^creatures~.~p~Yeah, that sounds like it could take you a while. Do that.~p~We'll pay you. How's... ~mission_rewards~ Spucks sound? Will that be enough to get you to leave?"
  "Fortune smiles upon you today, my fair entity. We have just such a task!~p~We have entered planet ~mission_target_planet~ in the Spaceminster Planetary Show-off Exhibition. It's the most prestigious event of its kind, and we've worked so hard preparing planet ~mission_target_planet~. Everything is just perfect!~p~Almost perfect, to be more precise. A small passel of ~mission_target_animal_species~ refuse to behave properly. The show is nearly upon us. Sadly, they must be eradicated."
  "There is nothing more pathetic than a fashion gone out of date. We are no longer amused by our mutant glow beasts on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Will you dispose of them for us?"
  "The joke is certainly on us! For aesthetic reasons, we created genetically altered animals on planet ~mission_target_planet~. They're very pretty, but now they're eating us! Can you keep us from becoming lunch?"
  "We went on a joyride and glow-splotched some of the animals on planet ~mission_target_planet~. How were we to know that glow-splotching infuriates this species? Can you aid us by turning the rampaging animals into aesthetically-satisfying cones of ash?"
 Zealot
  "Our sanctuary on planet ~mission_target_planet~, heretofore a model of zeal and piety, is now threatened by fiery, demonic beings. Will you deliver the faithful from this menace?"
  "Followers of the false God that Will Come have spread a plague among the animals of planet ~mission_target_planet~. Can you help us eradicate this menace?"
  "According to the laws of Spode, animals should be a help to the faithful. Yet a species of animal has risen up to plague the righteous! Will you aid us in destroying this unnatural menace?"
 Scientist
  "~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. A misplaced digit in a planetary survey has resulted in one of our planets in the ~mission_source_empire~ being seeded with the wrong sub-species. This aggressive animal is not only attacking other animals, but has become a threat to our citizens.~p~Would you be interested in helping us eradicating ~mission_target_animal_species~ from planet ~mission_target_planet~?"
  "~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. We regret to report that one of our experiments has not fulfilled its expectations. Instead of a placid, domesticated animal, a malprogrammed gene-splicer has inadvertently produced a ferocious, carnivorous species on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Will you be interested in helping us to rectify this error?"
  "~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. An unknown plague has begun to affect animals on planet ~mission_target_planet~, turning them into dangerous predators. May we employ you to eradicate them?"
  "~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~. An experiment in herbivory has gone disastrously wrong on planet ~mission_target_planet~, resulting in a formerly harmless species going mad and attacking other animals and even pack members. Can you help us with our little problem?"
 Trader
  "This miserable being is reluctant to bring himself to your attention, but an emergency compels him. A peaceful settlement of ~mission_source_empire~ has been attacked by predatory life-forms. This wretched one hopes you will be willing to undertake a mission to eradicate the carnivorous ~mission_target_animal_species~ from planet ~mission_target_planet~. A successful mission will be blessed with rewards!"
  "I am doleful at having to disturb your excellence with this news, but I am reluctantly compelled to inform you that planet ~mission_target_planet~ has been attacked by ravenous beasts, endangering the happiness of our people. In return for rewards, would you be willing to deal with this emergency?"
  "Woe is us! Word has reached our ears that a plague has spread among the animals of planet ~mission_target_planet~, turning them aggressive and violent. Humbly we request that your splendor, in return for adequate rewards, destroy these beasts."
 Shaman
  "One of our Chanting Circles on planet ~mission_target_planet~ seems to have called up the wrong spirit! We were hoping for a chat with our late Auntie Flrthrb, but instead we got a host of bodiless entities that possessed a group of animals, all of which are now running amok! Can you discorporate these beings for us? "
  "We try to be friends with all our animal brethren, but on ~mission_target_planet~ some of the animals have picked up a hostile vibration and are now wreaking havoc. Can you de-tune these creatures? Preferably with a laser? "
  "As trees strive to reach the sun, so animals too are part of a constant struggle for resources and mastery. One animal on planet ~mission_target_planet~ now threatens to dominate the world as we dominate the galaxy. Such an unstable situation should not be permitted to continue. Do you agree?"
  "The playful winds may carry the scent of flowers, or the stench of plague. An epidemic, perhaps spread by a cowardly enemy, has infected animals on planet ~mission_target_planet~. The infected are enraged and turned into predators. Would target practice interest you?"
  "We live in a cosmos filled with incredible violence, from the Big Bang and gamma ray emitters to the single-celled animals that engulf their prey. One animal on planet ~mission_target_planet~ displays courage and aggression bordering on madness. Perhaps they are a threat to security."
 Warrior
  "An infection needs eradication. Is your stomach strong enough to handle the job?"
 Grob

 Diplomat
  "Your contract calls for the 'restructuring and removal' of creatures numbering ~mission_num_kills_needed~ in the name of ~mission_target_animal_species~ to a vapor state.~p~Planet ~mission_target_planet~. ~group:star_clue~.~p~The targeted animals may be identified by their glowing tails.

  "Eradicating this species is a task unworthy of us, but it may be suitable for a species such as you. Planet ~mission_target_planet~ is in danger of being overrun by ~mission_target_animal_species~. Their tails glow, so killing them should be ridiculously easy.~p~Kill ~mission_num_kills_needed~ of the dangerous animals. ~group:star_clue~.~p~We will be watching, to make certain you complete this mission quickly and on schedule."
 Grob
  "Go to planet ~mission_target_planet~. ~group:star_clue~.~p~Kill ~mission_num_kills_needed~ tagged ~mission_target_animal_species~ ~^p^mission_num_kills_needed^creature^creatures~. That is all you need know."

Eradicate Animals Mission rejected:

  "Hmmm, that's unusual. We'd heard you generally accepted all manner of galactic quests.~p~Well, this is unfortunate.

  "A strange new alien microbe is aggressively targeting sentient species, and is currently spreading throughout the cities on the planet of ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ system.~p~We wish there were another way, but it appears our only chance at containment is to purge the sick from the population altogether.~p~We need you to eliminate all afflicted citizens, without incurring unacceptable losses among the healthy populace."
  "Revolutionaries are rioting on planet ~mission_target_planet~! We need you to rescue their victims!"

 Diplomat
  "The fundamentals of galactic civilization require that all species conform to laws chosen by a consensus of citizens. Regrettably, a minority on one of our federate worlds have chosen not to abide by this standard of conduct. Would you undertake a mission to restore peace on this world?"
  "The arrival of religious radicals preaching the 'Way of Spode' have caused civil unrest on one of our worlds. Though the Grand Council guarantees freedom of worship, they cannot tolerate disorder. Can you help us restore the rule of law on planet ~mission_target_planet~."
  "The citizens of a certain world have voted to join our federation. Unfortunately, a minority has chosen to respond with violence. Will you take upon yourself the task of rehabilitating these criminals so that the will of the majority may be upheld, and this new and promising species may join our peaceful federation?"
 Ecologist
  "We've been bullied up and down this galaxy for millennia by a secret cabal of thugs on planet ~mission_target_planet~. At grave peril to my people, we've obtained technology that can expose these monsters... ~p~We want you to find all the thugs, and turn them to ash!~p~We're usually not this vindictive, but have you ever endured an Event Horizon Swirlie? It's terrible!"
  "Illegal gene-hackers have spread a zombie plague on planet ~mission_target_planet~!~p~This epidemic causes people to attack others, thus spreading the infection.~p~Sadly, the zombies must be turned into healthy organic compost before the epidemic sweeps their whole world!~p~Will you help us in this mission? "
  "A plague landed from space is replacing our citizens on planet ~mission_target_planet~ with alien duplicates grown in pods! These creatures are attacking our citizens! Will you help us erase this menace?"
  "A rogue scientist named Garb is at work on planet ~mission_target_planet~! He has created a brain implant which erases a person's memory and fills it with a desire to obey only Grox. He is in danger of subverting the entire population! Will you help us?"
 Bard
  "Achh! The stench! You can smell it for parsecs! It befouls and bedevils our keen olfactory senses!~p~It's the ~mission_target_planet~ citizens, you know. Placing tact and decorum aside for the moment, some of them are literally stinking up the heavens!~p~We've petitioned them to alter their hygiene, but to no avail. Enough, we say! It's time these malodorous maladroits were given a thorough cleansing! With lasers!"
  "We hate to admit it... but a silly little prank has gone awry.~p~To cause confusion, we created clones of the people of planet ~mission_target_planet~ and unleashed them into the cities.~p~Imagine! Walking down the street and seeing the same person over and over! What fun!"
  "We know a secret! No, no we couldn't possibly tell.~p~Fine! You win. We know of a certain planet that has been infiltrated by an evil force that will soon destroy all of its citizens.~p~Isn't that funny!? No??"
  "It wasn't us... or was it? Well, we can't recall... But the point is this.~p~Pun-telling robots, disguised as locales, were deposited onto planet ~mission_target_planet~ all in the name of fun... but we forgot a bit of programming and now we need to remove these droids before they take over the planet! "
 Zealot
  "Treacherous worshippers of the God That Will Come are attacking Spode's people on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Our military is supporting missionary work elsewhere and cannot respond immediately. Can you help us crush these wicked and willful enemies of Spode? "

 Trader
  "Rioters on another world are threatening to loot our peaceful trading mission. As we are a peaceful people, our own possible responses are limited. Many rewards will be offered to anyone who can save our endangered kindred. Does the possibility of reward tempt you?"
  "Dissatisfied customers are attacking our boutiques on planet ~mission_target_planet~! Our kindred are in danger! If we offer you rewards, will you help us?"
  "Healthy interstellar competition resulted in the collapse of several industries on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Dismissed workers are now rioting, threatening to overturn the social order! Can this unworthy one trouble your excellence for aid, in return for reward?"
 Shaman
  "Strange alien missionaries who worship something called Spode arrived on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Now the converts are trying to kill those of us who follow the God That Will Come.

 Warrior
  "Missionaries spreading the Word of Spode have launched an attack on planet ~mission_target_planet~. Would you enjoy some target practice? "
  "A renegade militarist group, preaching a War Against All has launched an insurrection on planet ~mission_target_planet~. We can suppress them easily, but these cultists will be far more humiliated if their insurrection is suppressed by another species. Would you aid us? "
  "An enemy biological strike against planet ~mission_target_planet~ has infected a number of our citizens, and turned them dangerous. As you are another species and cannot be infected, we ask you to cope with this situation."
 Grob

  "Those causing trouble are carrying bright incendiaries and seem to glow. They will need to be removed. But don't hurt civilians or damage property."
 Diplomat
  "This mission requires a deft touch. We will deny any involvement, so the best thing to do is not get caught.~p~If you are seen eradicating sick individuals, it will trigger a panic. If an entire city becomes panicked, you can expect military retaliation from the city's defenses."
 Ecologist
  "The altered citizens glow in the dark, so they should be easy to find. Save the world by destroying them... and please don't harm friendly citizens or structures.~p~This mission is time-critical, so begin at once, and work fast!"

  "Eliminate these beings from among the populace for the good of all. They have taken a unique, cultish costume that glows brightly under all conditions. This should make them easy for you to distinguish."
 Trader
  "We're not a proud race, but our cowardice is legendary. If you get caught, we're gonna act like we don't even know you, so it's important not to cause an alarm.~p~If you cause too much panic, you'll be attacked by the city.~p~And just so we're clear, we do *not* got your back."
 Shaman
  "The troublemakers are all wearing glowing makeup, so it won't be hard to find them.~p~They should all be sent to their next incarnation, but please don't harm any plants or buildings, and don't hurt any innocent people. They've been traumatized enough. "

  "Studies have shown that the best approach is to employ your Spacecraft's Mind Erase Ray, assuming you have one. It's simple, it's effective, and theoretically, it's hilarious.~p~Please, be thorough in all regards. We can't afford a mass panic, much less a pandemic!~p~Do this successfully, and we'll give you ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks."
 Diplomat
  "We would stress to carry out your work as discretely as possible.~p~Alternatively, our information has shown panic can be subdued with the Mind Erase device. You might want to make sure your ship is equipped with one.~p~"
 Ecologist
  "We get worked up into a tizzy (existential dread, you know) about once a month, and nothing soothes away worries like a little Mind Erase Ray to the temple. You should try that, assuming you have one.~p~Rid us of this menace, and we'll give you ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks."
  "If you don't have a Mind Erase tool, you might consider getting one. It will calm any citizen who becomes agitated.~p~For this unfortunate but critical task, we will pay handsome fee of ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks! "
 Bard
  "A panicked citizenry is always a hot bother, but fret not. A solution lies at the ready! Simply placate the plebes with the liberal dose of your Mind Erase Ray. You do have one?~p~We have an old saying here: 'What you don't know and can't smell, won't hurt you'. Hoo hah. Hoo hah. Guffaw. How Delightfully ribald!~p~For your efforts, you shall be remunerated with ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks."
 Zealot
  "Shoot not your target in front of the feeble minded, but if it cannot be avoided, they are equally swayed with a device of Mind Erase. Get one you should."
 Scientist
  "It would be logical to carry out your work as discretely as possible.~p~Alternatively, our research has shown panic can be subdued with the Mind Erase device. If your vessel is not equipped with one, you should consider getting one.~p~"
 Trader
  "The Mind Erase Ray in my spacecraft always works like a charm. I use it all the time. On others.~p~It really gives me that edge that I need to get ahead, if you know what I mean.~p~This job comes with like a HUGE pay-raise, so you make this happen for me, and I'll hook you up with ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks."
 Shaman
  "It would be wise to carry out your work as discretely as possible.~p~Alternatively, our research has shown panic can be subdued with the Mind Erase device. We hope your ship has one equipped.~p~"
 Warrior
  "Ha! This part's the best!~p~To calm down uppity citizens, use your Mind Erase Ray. That always shuts 'em right up!~p~No memory, no foul! Am I right? Ha Ha! Hope you have one.~p~The pay's good - ~mission_rewards~ Spucks."
 Grob

  "Citizens of the federation participate freely in all activities permitted by the decision of the majority.

 Diplomat
  "Our covenant guarantees that our citizens will remain free from want. Yet a plague has removed certain species from the Life Web of our farming planet ~mission_target_planet~ and imperiled production of food. Will you undertake a mission to save the Life Web and keep this food source vital?"
  "A shift of the magnetic poles of planet ~mission_target_planet~ has resulted in a cosmic ray bombardment that has destroyed important links in the planet's Food Web. The Grand Council is doing its best to prevent bio-disaster. Perhaps you can be of service?"
  "A biological strike by domestic terrorists has badly damaged the Food Web of planet ~mission_target_planet~. The Grand Council is attempting to restore security, but in the meantime our concern is to restore the planet to vitality. Can you help us?"

  "planet ~mission_target_planet~ was a perfect place for people who wanted to lose weight, since the ecosystem was so incomplete that it was difficult to find any food at all. But now we're totally into self-acceptance, and diets are a thing of the past! Can you help planet ~mission_target_planet~ become fashionable again?"
  "During the Autumn Festival, our people go out into the wilderness and eat nuts, berries, and wild animals. Unfortunately the people on planet ~mission_target_planet~ were having such a good time that the party went on and on, and now whole species are extinct. There's nothing left to eat! Can you fix the biome so we can plan picnics again?"

  "Such an insignificant being as myself can barely bring herself to trouble such a magnificent one as you, but I am compelled by necessity. A series of plagues have eradicated key life-forms on planet ~mission_target_planet~, and now our settlement is threatened with extinction. Could you possibly be bothered to aid them, in exchange of course, for munificent rewards?"
 Shaman
  "Despite our sacrificing flowers to the Volcano Goddess, a massive eruption blocked the sun's rays from planet ~mission_target_planet~, and resulted in the extinction of several species. Now the whole planet is dying! Can you help us restore the balance of nature?"

  "Planet ~mission_target_planet~ has been judged a suitable candidate for terraforming. Our own terraforming units are engaged elsewhere, but we thought you might be able to accomplish this mission for us. Would you help us expand the galactic life web?"
  "Our mission is to spread life throughout the galaxy. You can help us by terraforming planet ~mission_target_planet~. Would you be interested in this task?"
 Bard
  "Did you know our Empress has the most extensive collection of show-worthy miniature Oogies in this entire arm of the Galaxy? It is true! Are you not impressed?~p~They've outgrown their current kennel-moon, so we'd like you to terraform planet ~mission_target_planet~, in the ~mission_target_star~ system.~p~The Empress' Oogies are very particular, so please make sure you bring the terraform score to level ~mission_terraform_target_score~.~p~These Oogies are a treasure of our Empire, so we'll pay you ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks."
  "We'd like to create a new party planet! It needs balmy breezes, picturesque landscapes, a variety of greenery capable of being turned into delicious beverages, and some interesting animals. Would you like to build it for us? "
  "We've found a worn-out old planet that we'd like to do over! Would you like to demonstrate your decorating skills?"
  "There's nothing wrong with the ~mission_target_star~ system, but it's a boring old collection of planets! We'd like to liven up the neighborhood with a tres chic restyle! Would you like to handle that for us?"
 Zealot
  "It is our task, given to us by Spode himself, that the barren places of the universe be made fruitful. A barren world has been found at star system ~mission_target_star~. Would you be interested in populating it with Spode's glorious creations?"
  "Holy pilgrims stand ready to populate a new world! This planet must be made ready for our species, however... would you render it suitable for Spode's People?"
  "Spode commands us to bring the Light of Spode into all dark places! Unfortunately we can't do this if we can't breathe... could you possibly terraform planet ~mission_target_planet~ for us, so that we can use it as a springboard to bring Spode's Light through the galaxy?"
 Scientist
  "We are interested in discovering as much as possible about the universe, which of course includes our neighbors and their technology. A suitable world has been found at star system ~mission_target_star~. Would you be interested in giving us a demonstration of your abilities? In return for your cooperation, we would offer you suitable rewards."
  "A world has been found that may be suitable for settlement once a proper ecology has been established. Our own terraforming crews are busy on other projects. Would you be interesting in terraforming a world for us?"
  "Planet ~mission_target_planet~ is suitable for terraforming. This is a massive undertaking, and we wonder if ~player_creature_name~ are up to it?"
 Trader
  "Buddy, we got a great project going. Check it:~p~We're growing Designer Consumers for our parent corporation, ObsequiCorp.~p~We need you to terraform planet ~mission_target_planet~, in the ~mission_target_star~ system.~p~If you can bring the planetary Terraform Level to ~mission_terraform_target_score~, we can deposit our Consumer Species on planet ~mission_target_planet~ and start generating profits for ObsequiCorp.~p~And buddy, it's worth ~mission_rewards~ Spucks."
  "All the galaxy stands in awe of your knowledge and power. Perhaps this miserable creature may tempt you to a display of your terraforming prowess at star system ~mission_target_star~. Would you consent to a demonstration in return for magnificent rewards?"
  "A new world beckons, ready to be filled with consumers! But some adjustments to the environment are needed before a settlement can be contemplated. Making such adjustments would be trivial to a being of your magnificence... perhaps you could be tempted with a reward?"
  "Our philosopher Gundrab named the Three Desirables: a gullible customer, a full purse, and a new planet bulging with natural resources ready to be exploited! This exploitation would be made easier if the planet were terraformed first... perhaps, in exchange for a generous commission, you would be willing to perform this task for us?"
 Shaman
  "We're very much interested in the soul of ~player_creature_name~, and there's nothing so revealing of soul than the works of its creation. We've found a barren planet in the ~mission_target_star~ system, and we'd like you to reveal your soul by terraforming it. Would you reveal your soul for us?"
  "Our seers tell us that the world-spirit of the barren ~mission_target_planet~ system yearns for a population to understand and care for it. Perhaps you would like to render it suitable for our settlement?"
  "Planet ~mission_target_planet~ is like a blank canvas waiting the first kiss of the brush! Would you like to be the painter?"
 Warrior
  "The richest and most powerful among us have decided that we've had enough of a bunch of poor and powerless ne'er-do-wells tryin' ta leech offa us like a buncha parasites, so we're getting outta here! Let's see how they like that!~p~Go to planet ~mission_target_planet~. It's in the ~mission_target_star~ system. Bring the terraform score to level ~mission_terraform_target_score~ in preparation for our relocation.~p~We'll pay you ~mission_rewards~ Spucks."
  "If planet ~mission_target_planet~ were terraformed, it would make an excellent forward military base. Would you be willing to contract this work? "
  "We are interested in the concept of non-destructive terraforming. Would you provide us with a demonstration?"
  "Planet ~mission_target_planet~ is suitable for terraforming. We would be interested in discovering whether this is within your capabilities."
 Grob

  "I could use a little more detail on how to get there"
  "May I have some directions?"

 Response 2
  "Ugh. Terraforming is a chore. No thanks."

You need to destroy those turrets!~p~But here's the catch, buddy - you can't hurt anyone, or destroy any buildings. That would only make things worse.~p~You down?"
  "The ~mission_source_empire~ is overwhelmed with frustration and anger. Some of our wretched citizens are being oppressed by the militarist species of planet ~mission_target_planet~. Great rewards would be offered to anyone who could liberate them!"
  "This unworthy one is consumed with wretchedness and self-flagellation! A conspiracy of dissatisfied customers has seized control of the defenses of planet ~mission_target_planet~, and are demanding a refund! Naturally we cannot violate the sanctity of a contract in order to oblige them.~p~Would you be willing to rectify this matter on our behalf in exchange for a generous fee?"
  "Alas, wickedness so pervades the universe! Industrialists seeking to enforce a high tariff have occupied the turrets of planet ~mission_target_planet~ and are threatening to lock out our cheap, customer-friendly imports! Can you help us, in return for a delightful sum?"
 Shaman
  "We hate to be judgmental, but in our opinion the members of the Maniac Suicide Cult who seized the defense network of planet ~mission_target_planet~ have begun to push the outer limits of our tolerance. Perhaps you would agree to do a little something in order to discourage them?"
  "The defenses of planet ~mission_target_planet~ have fallen into the hands of an evil entity summoned from a dark dimension. Or maybe a rogue hacker. In any case, can you rescue our citizens?"
  "A group of animal rights militants have seized control of planet ~mission_target_planet~ and are holding the citizens for ransom unless we forego the eating of animal protein! This we cannot do, as we absolutely leave it to a person's conscience whether they choose to eat free-range animals raised without use of antibiotics, or to let them live a natural lifespan.~p~We shun the use of force, but yet we find that violence seems strangely attractive in this situation. Would you wield your lasers in the name of dietary freedom?"
 Warrior
  "Yeah, we got something you can do for us, but it's tricky business...~p~Don't go askin' questions why, but we need you to destroy all the turrets on planet ~mission_target_planet~. But ya can't do damage to buildings. Or even the citizenry.~p~This is a surgical strike.~p~Ya think you're up to it?"
  "Violent cultists who venerate something called the Unknown God have seized the defense systems on planet ~mission_target_planet~. It would interest us greatly to discover if you can cope with this. "
  "Fanatic militarists demanding a War Against All have seized power on planet ~mission_target_planet~. The best way to pop their bubbles would be for an alien species to neutralize their defensive emplacements. Are you willing?"
  "Defense computers on planet ~mission_target_planet~ have been subverted by a clever enemy. Though we could handle this situation ourselves, we would rather let our enemy know that we can call on other species to help us. Would this interest you?"

  "Such wondrous news! Here is your compensation - ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks, just as promised.~p~It's always so satisfying to bring a sense of style to a world so clearly lacking in taste and refined sensibilities.~p~The Fashion Police have done good work here today. We all have.~p~Now, onto other matters: About that spaceship you're flying..."

We love the little guy so much!~p~*Sniff*~p~The ~mission_target_empire~ captured him, but now that you've safely disabled their defenses, we can get Mr. Giggles back.~p~And then planet ~mission_target_planet~ will reap a terrible whirlwind!"

War Mission briefing 1:
 MySpecies
  "We're at war with the ~mission_target_empire~! Now is the time to strike! "
  "Captain, now is the time to bring the war to the enemy! Attack ~mission_target_planet~!"
  "It's time to teach the aggressive ~mission_target_empire~ a lesson! "
 Diplomat
  "A fundamental right of all citizens is to be free from violence and fear. Yet the inhabitants of ~mission_target_planet~ have militarized their society and now constitute a threat not only to our civilization, but to the peace of the galaxy.~p~Will you stand with us against this menace?"
  "Another species has killed our peaceful diplomatic mission and attacked our planets. As it is a principle of our civilization to remain free from violence, we are mobilizing against the enemy. In the meantime, however, can you do your part?"
  "The Grand Council desires all species to live in harmony. Nevertheless, another race has attacked our worlds. While we battle them on our home ground, it appears that one of their worlds is undefended. Will you help us bring the war to the enemy?"
 Ecologist
  "Oh, my stars! Please! Help us! We beg of you! The ~mission_target_empire~, won't leave us be! They're threatening to stuff our planet into a gigantic locker if we don't give them our lunch money.~p~We have low blood sugar - we need lunch! Please! You must deal with these bullies! Destroy or capture every city on planet ~mission_target_planet~. It seems drastic, but it's the only way they'll learn."
  "Despite our best efforts to live in peace with our neighbors, we're being attacked by a life-hating civilization. Can you help us defend ourselves from this menace? "
  "A vicious alien race has attacked our civilization! While our forces devote themselves to protecting our fragile planetary balance, can you lead the counter-attack on one of their home worlds?"
  "A peaceful exploration party has been massacred by an alien civilization. Will you help us fight these aggressors?"
 Bard
  "Alas! Is it, perchance, a savior, sent by the very heavens to save us from our wretched destiny?~p~The ~mission_target_empire~ have set all manner of fell beast upon us. Their attacks are merciless! Our people teeter on the precipice!~p~We beseech you with utmost humility: set out for ~mission_target_planet~ and destroy or capture every metropolis you find there. Only then will we be freed from their tyrannical oppression!"
  "We're being attacked by a very tedious species that's interested only in terror and violence. The monotony of it all is driving us mad!~p~Perhaps beings of your vitality and simple martial virtue can be of service to us. What do you say?"
  "If there's anything calculated to ruin a Festival of Visual Delights, it's a bunch of alien warmongers with laser cannons and bombs! We hate to be inhospitable, but they keep blowing up our prettiest things!~p~Can you help us to convince these party-crashers to go home?"
  "Here we were, minding our own business, and suddenly a militarist species appeared in our skies and started lobbing high explosives at us! Could you possibly pop over to one of their worlds and give them a taste of their own medicine?"
 Zealot
  "Another species defies the Way of Spode by refusing our generous offer of conversion! These vile and wretched beings defy us!~p~The Will of Spode demands that these beings be reduced to their constituent atoms! Will you join us in making war on these perverse creatures? "
  "Our efforts to convert a certain world to the Way of Spode has met with unanticipated resistance. Will you help us?"
  "Diabolical forces have tricked the forces of another civilization into declaring war on the Worlds of Spode!  Will you help us crush them?"
  "The Will of Spode demands that these beings be reduced to their constituent atoms! Will you join us in making war on these perverse creatures?"
 Scientist
  "The ~mission_target_empire~ has declared war on us and massacred a scientific research team. This treacherous behavior has caught us by surprise. Would you help us defend ourselves against this menace?"
  "We have been subjected to a vicious raid by the expansionist ~mission_target_empire~. If we fall to the enemy, you'll be next on their list! Can we count on your aid?"
  "The military forces of the ~mission_target_empire~ are fully engaged with our own fleet. This leaves an opportunity for our friends to smash one of their worlds! Will you help us win this decisive victory?"
 Trader
  "Listen, I'm only telling you this 'cause you know I love ya, right? The ~mission_target_empire~ were totally talking smack about you. Terrible things were said, buddy. Your mom was mentioned. More than once.~p~I would never tell you what to do, but if I was you, I'd go straight to ~mission_target_planet~, and I'd destroy or capture every city I saw! This is about the future of the galactic economy!"
  "The ~mission_source_empire~ are a peaceful nation, yet we find ourselves in the position of being attacked by another species! We beg your aid in helping us to defend ourselves from these violent and tyrannical race. Enormous rewards may be anticipated by anyone agreeing to be our friend."
  "Behold the most wretched and unhappy of beings! Our worlds are being attacked by an aggressor species, and it is all we can do to defend ourselves!~p~If our noble and heroic friends, however, were to attack the enemy in their home systems, we would offer them compensation equal to their greatness!"
  "The ~mission_source_empire~ desire only to bring happiness to the galaxy, but those who oppose this noble goal will stop at nothing to prevent us! We are being attacked by another species!~p~We know that this loathsome empire would crumble before your magnificence if you were only to bestir yourselves. Perhaps the offer of rewards would tempt you?"
 Shaman
  "We were explaining the virtues of aura balancing and cleansing to an alien species, and suddenly they began to attack us!~p~Though we deplore violence, we feel that the karmic balance should nevertheless be restored. What do you think?"
  "An alien species is attacking our worlds! We keep sending them peaceful vibrations, but it's not working!~p~Perhaps you can introduce them to the law of equal and opposite reaction? "
  "We keep trying to negotiate with this new species we discovered, but every time we try to talk to them, they start shooting!~p~Perhaps you could show them that there are two sides to this 'shooting' business?"
 Warrior
  "The ~mission_target_empire~ thinks it's soooooo great. Primpin' and preenin' like they own the universe! Dagnabbit! That will not stand!~p~It's about time they was knocked down to size, hmmmm? Tell ya what? Go to ~mission_target_planet~ and lay waste to every city there. We'll make it worth your while for giving those whippersnappers their comeuppance!"
  "The ~mission_target_empire~ has foolishly declared war on us. While we engage and destroy their invading fleets, perhaps it might amuse you to attack their lightly-defended home worlds?"
  "The surest way of killing a snake is to strike at the head. We are at war with the ~mission_target_empire~ and have discovered a lightly defended enemy world. Bring us their heads on a platter!"
  "We are engaged in a victorious war against the ~mission_target_empire~. Would you care to rise in our esteem by helping us to crush them?"
 Grob
  "MISSION REQUEST: Planetary downsizing event required on ~mission_target_planet~.~p~MISSION TARGET: ~mission_target_empire~.~p~MISSION SPECIFICS: Destroy or capture all metropolitan areas.~p~REASONING/OTHER: They know what they did!~p~QUERY: Do you accept mission parameters?"

  "Never. I won't participate in this travesty!"
  "Nuh uh. Do it yourself. I don't wanna."
  "Kill them yourself."
  "I must regretfully decline"

War Mission briefing 2:
 MySpecies
  "We knew we could count on you! ~mission_target_planet~ can be found within the ~mission_target_star~ system.~p~We know you must find this to be a terrible burden to bear, to say nothing of the ethical implications alone! However, if you complete this grave task successfully, we'll give you ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks."
  "~mission_target_planet~ belongs to the ~mission_target_empire~, and orbits ~mission_target_star~. We're counting on you to travel there and destroy all cities!"
 Diplomat
  "~mission_target_planet~, orbiting ~mission_target_star~, has a full range of offensive and defensive armament, but the Grand Council expresses its confidence in your ability to neutralize the aggressor forces."
 Ecologist
  "Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thank you! We'd do it ourselves, but we're just not suited for warfare. Hemophilia runs rampant throughout our gene pool, and our motor skills could be better.~p~Go to planet ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ system and wipe the cities clean of those bullies for ~mission_rewards~ Spucks."
  "Our attackers are known to inhabit ~mission_target_planet~, orbiting ~mission_target_star~. Travel there at once and return the planet to a state of nature!"
 Bard
  "Hep Hep Huzzah! Your extreme derring-do and flinty, unflinching gaze shall be praised in verse by our many fine amateur poets. Set out for ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ system, post haste! For your valiant and heroic efforts, you shall be awarded ~mission_rewards~ Sporebucks as material recompensation, though I daresay, living forever in our densely florid prosaic works can't be affixed with a price."
  "Our aesthetic technicians have had a look at the warmongers' planet, and the architecture is unspeakably dreary. If you could fly to ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ system and destroy or capture all the cities, something worthwhile might be built on the ruins.~p~Or not."
 Zealot
  "The willful and degenerate enemy, who worship the false God That Will Come, are at ~mission_target_planet~.   Destroy them, and Spode will reward you."
 Scientist
  "The enemy are at ~mission_target_planet~, orbiting ~mission_target_star~. They are intractable, and implacably hostile. You can aid us by destroying or capturing their cities."
 Trader
  "Excellent. So, go to ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ system and show those nerfy-lookin' scruffherders that they can't talk about my mom that way! I mean, your mom! *Sigh* Just do it. We'll pay. How's ~mission_rewards~ Spucks sound?"
  "The vile enemy congregate at ~mission_target_planet~, orbiting ~mission_target_star~. Level their cities! Let the survivors have nothing to eat but the ashes of the dead!"
 Shaman
  "We feel that the world of ~mission_target_planet~, orbiting ~mission_target_star~, is choked with urban blight. The inhabitants might be less belligerent if they lived free in nature, so please destroy or capture all cities."
 Warrior
  "Yeah! That's the fightin' spirit! Have at 'em! Get fired up!~p~You got that fire in your belly? Are you urgin' for a purgin'? Then, quick! Head to ~mission_target_planet~ in the ~mission_target_star~ system and lay waste to their cities. Lay waste real good now. I don't want to hear tales o' no survivors. Do that, and we'll will give you ~mission_rewards~ Spucks."
  "The universe raises up life forms only to fling them into the flames. Only the ~mission_source_empire~ are eternal.~p~The enemy are at ~mission_target_planet~, orbiting ~mission_target_star~. Fling them into the flames by destroying or capturing their cities."
 Grob

 Response 1
  "Alright. Sounds like a challenge I'll do it."
  "Wetworks! Sounds like a larf! I'll do it."
  "I've always wanted to really lay into those guys. I'll do it."
  "The ~mission_target_empire~? I hate those guys. I'm in!"
  "Anything to serve you."
 Response 2
  "This feels like bad karma, times a bajillion."
  "I just can't tolerate this level of violence."
  "No way. No how. Not now. Not ever."
  "No. No. A million times no."
  "With much regret, I cannot do what you ask."

War Mission accept:
 MySpecies
  "Thank you! It pains us to send you on a task such as this, but we've exhausted our every option. Be strong."
  "We're depending on you to bring the war to a victorious conclusion!"
 Diplomat
  "You have demonstrated the instincts of a good galactic citizen.~p~While we deplore the necessity of using violence against an intelligent species, in this case the inhabitants of ~mission_target_planet~ have shown themselves immune to reason, and we lack an alternative. Please travel to ~mission_target_planet~ and destroy or capture all cities."
 Ecologist
  "You agree? We're... we're besides ourselves with gratitude. We don't know how to thank you. We are so unworthy! We prostrate ourselves before you. I'm totally misting up here."
  "Thank you for agreeing to help us. Travel to ~mission_target_planet~ and destroy or capture their cities."
 Bard
  "We shall light a candle for each night you are gone. We ooze with anticipation of your safe passage, righteous victory, and speedy return. Literally ooze. It's a problem we have when we're anxious. Do be quick."

 Shaman
  "We're pleased that you find yourselves in philosophical agreement with us. We'll chant for your success."

War Mission rejected:
 MySpecies
  "I can't say your actions will aid your reputation, but I can't say I blame you either. Intergalactic extermination is a tricky business, fraught with all sorts of knotty ethical dilemmas."
  "But, but... we're at war! Quitting is desertion."
 Diplomat
  "We understand the reluctance to employ violence. Let us suggest next time, don't get wrapped up in the details. Farewell."
 Ecologist
  "No? Oh, well we apologize profusely if we disturbed you in anyway. We had to ask.~p~I suppose we'll get used to it. It's not like we haven't been stuffed into lockers before. Or worse."
  "We understand your reluctance. We'll have to face this menace on our own."
 Bard
  "Though 'tis us that shall bear the mighty onslaught of the ravening hordes of the ~mission_target_empire~. Already, the airwaves are filled with songs of your perennial failures. I'd hide your face for awhile."

 Zealot

  "I can't believe you're going to just let this slide! I mean - this is how it begins, right? First, they talk bad about your mom, but it's cool. Rise above.~p~But then they start saying other things, and soon, there's no limit to amount of smack they can talk. Then what? I only say this to you as a friend."
  "We are devastated! We are a weak, sniveling species, and now we must fight alone. You credit line at the bazaar is suspended. Goodbye."
 Shaman
  "In that case, we'll have to attack the enemy on the astral plane. Stay out of the way."
 Warrior

  "We hate to remind you, but you said you'd go to ~mission_target_planet~ and estroy-day the ities-say. Consult your Mission Log if you think we're lying! When can we expect some aesthetically-satisfying eruptions of debris?"
 Zealot

 Scientist
  "Our scans indicate that the enemy still resists at ~mission_target_planet~. Has your Mission Log not received the commission? Will you destroy or capture their cities?"
 Trader
  "You forgot the mission? I know how it goes. It's tough when a whole species talks bad about your mom. It just gets you so angry, you forget the little stuff. It's okay.~p~You need to go to ~mission_target_planet~ and get rid of the ~mission_target_empire~. For the things they said. About your mom."

Player helped with disaster:
 MySpecies
  "Thanks for showing up. Without you, this would have been a real nightmare. We really appreciate your help!"
  "Thanks for the help! You really saved the day back there. It would have been terrible without you."
  "Wow, you're a true hero! We don't know what we would have done if you hadn't shown up. Thank you!"
 Diplomat
  "Thank you. We will immediately submit an Expedited Motion for Grateful Acknowledgement. The paperwork should come through within two Galactic Standard Years."
  "We humbly appreciate your assistance. Your efforts here will be recorded in the Official Registry of Good Deeds and Positive Actions."
  "Thank you for your assistance. Without your help, we might not have completed our Vote of Preparation For Planning to Take Immediate Action."
 Ecologist
  "Wow, that could have been nasty. But you totally rocked this place! Thanks... thanks for everything."
  "That could have been ugly! Looks like you saved the day, you know? You're a real hero to our people."
  "That was... You were... It was... Wow. You really made the difference. You have our thanks!"
 Bard
  "Joyous day! We're clever, but not clever enough to guess what might have happened without your help! You have our thanks."
  "We're safe, we're saved! Should someone get credit? Maybe, yes, no... Of course someone should, it's you! Thank you so much!"
  "Hooray for the ~player_species~! We'll sing a song of thanks in your name, and we'll do it every day, until we forget!"
 Zealot
  "The Will of Spode brings a ~player_creature_name~ to aid us in our time of need! Thanks be unto Spode, and also unto thee, noble ~player_creature_name~."
  "A thousand appreciations of the ~race~ are thine, ~player_title~ of the ~player_species~, for assistance given here this day."
  "The ~race~ offer many thanks to the ~player_species~. Thou shalt be remembered for rendering aid in a time of trouble."

  "~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~, we owe you a debt of gratitude. Your efforts on our behalf will not be forgotten."
 Trader
  "Thanks for the help! I bet we couldn't have done it without you. Keep in mind, I don't bet too often... We're market opportunists, not gamblers."
  "Thanks for keeping us in business! You can't even begin to imagine how much profit we stood to lose without your intervention."
  "Thanks for helping out! This kind of external assistance is exactly what helps us maintain our low, low insurance premiums."
 Shaman
  "Thank you, friend. A being who helps in times of need is a blessing to his allies, and shall be blessed in return."

Player did not help with disaster:
 MySpecies
  "Hey, where were you? You had better not make a habit of disappearing when trouble shows up."
  "Thanks for nothing! You've got that fancy flying contraption, so how about you use it to help out every now and then?"
  "Well, thanks for showing up... Too bad you came too late to do anything useful. Try to be a little more responsive in the future."
 Diplomat
  "The situation has already been resolved without your help. In the future, should we call upon you for assistance, we would appreciate your promptness."
  "I'm sorry, but twelve of the thirteen Official Keepers of Subjective Time agree that you have arrived too late to be useful. Thank you for coming."
  "You're too late. We already deployed our Emergency Protocol for Times of Moderate to Severe Crisis. All that's left is paperwork, and we can handle that ourselves, thank you."
 Ecologist
  "Not to be harsh, but you need to be a little more... responsive, you know? You totally missed all the action."
  "Nature can fend for itself, but it still likes the help, you know? Things could have gone better... if you had been here."
  "Sorry, but you're way too late to help. It's all right. Life goes on. It would go on better, though, if you responded faster in the future."
 Bard
  "Oh, calamity, despair! You have arrived too late to be of any use. Perhaps in the future, as you sing and dance and cavort throughout the universe, you could also pay attention to the passage of time?"
  "Let us tell you a story... it involves the ~player_species~, and the ~race~, and our utter disappointment at the lack of timely assistance. You should be able to guess how the story goes."
  "Hooray for the ~player_species~!' That's what we might have sung, had you shown up in time to do anything. It's far too late now, of course."
 Zealot
  "The ~player_species~ send aid, but they send it too late to be of use. Thine fault is tardiness, under the Judgement of Spode."
  "We have handled the situation ourselves, a thousand thanks be to Spode. No thanks be to the ~player_species~ for their un-timeliness."
  "The ~race~ emerge unscathed, all glory and thanks be to Spode. Shouldst thou wish to share in future glories, thou shalt be prompt in response."
 Scientist
  "~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~, your failure to deliver timely assistance has endangered our research. We would appreciate promptness on future occasions."
  "~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~, you are too late to be of assistance. Please try to arrive quickly if we should call upon you again for help."
  "~player_title~ ~player_creature_name~, the situation has already been resolved. Your tardiness, regardless of intention, is not appreciated."
 Trader
  "Thanks for showing up, but the losses are already on the books at this point. A ~player_creature_name~ like yourself must have lots of important things to do."
  "Phew, that was a close one! You wouldn't believe how close it was. You might have seen how close it was, if you had shown up in time! Actually, it wouldn't have been close at all with your help. But it's too late to change that now. Too late, indeed."
  "It's too late to do anything now. Just between us, you should be glad that our lawyers aren't pressing you for damages due to tardiness."
 Shaman
  "It is over and finished. Thank you for your eventual arrival, friend, but there is nothing left to be done."
  "We have handled the situation ourselves. We thank you for coming, but you are too late to be of assistance."
  "It is too late, friend. Please do not apologize, a hand extended in time is worth a thousand apologies after the fact."
 Warrior
  "~player_species~ is late. Too late. We ~race~ have dealt with the situation for now."
  "~player_species~ comes to help, but the time for help is already over."
  "~player_species~ arrives too late to help us. Next time ~player_species~ must not be late."
 Grob
  "Dismissal. This ~player_creature_name~ did not arrive promptly. We have no need of aid at this time."
  "STATUS REPORT: Situation is already under control. This ~player_creature_name~ was useless in this matter."
  "The situation has been resolved. This ~player_creature_name~ was not present at the appropriate time."

 Bard
  "The party's over- we were attacked by the Grox! You're welcome to come roister another time."

 Zealot
  "The Children of Spode were just attacked by the diabolical machines of the Grox! We do not have time to deal with petitioners right now- come back later."

 Trader
  "The Grox blew up our stuff! The boutique is closed! Come back later!"
  "The Grox attacked us! We can't decide whether to raise our prices or have a fire sale, so come again later!"
 Shaman
  "If our auras seem dark, it's because we were attacked by the Grox! We're chanting for a protective shield, so we can't talk to you right now. Come another time."
  "We were trying to explain numerology to the Grox, and they attacked us! We're busy right now... Come back later."
 Warrior
  "We're mobilizing our forces after an unprovoked attack by the Grox. We're too busy to deal with you right now... Maybe later."
  "We have been attacked by the Grox. We are preparing massive retaliation, and can't deal with other matters. Return later, after our triumph."

Empire explains philosophy:
 Diplomat
  "We, the ~race~, subscribe to the Philosophy of Order. Visit the Grand Council and you'll see our motto etched on its doors: Peace is the child of Order and Reason. We seek to bring all nations, races, and empires to Order.~p~We offer the Super-Technology of Static Cling. This neutralizes the messy turrets of hostile cities against our Space Ships and allies, whilst we reason with their leadership."
  "We, the ~race~ follow the Philosophy of Order. Our Councils keep the Harmony and update all the forms and Galactic Calendars. It's the way of measurable progress. Without Order, the garbage just piles up!~p~Speaking of which, we have Static Cling Super-Technology. We use this to halt the turrets of disorderly cities anywhere, so we can negotiate them into an alliance... And make sure the forms get filed on time, in triplicate."
  "We, the ~race~ subscribe to the practice of Order. When we are not forming alliances, our Grand Council is organizing the Sub-Councils. It all fits together so neatly!~p~We offer the Super-Technology of Static Cling to halt all terrestrial turret defenses. Turrets must be silenced to form an alliance! Ahem."
 Ecologist
  "We, the ~race~ follow the Scrolls of Life.~p~We are the heavens, the celestial light, the stars! We are the soil, the water and the air... We believe in the harmony of the universe and everything in it. We are just part of a greater whole, we are fleeting! Soon we will tell you what awaits you if you join us..."
  "We, the ~race~ follow the Scrolls of Life.~p~These Scrolls teach that it is incumbent upon us to preserve our natural world... To take nothing but memories from our surroundings and to plant ideas and reap peace! To sow magic, man. Soon we will tell you what awaits you if you join us..."
  "Listen, dude, and we will tell you what's up. We, the ~race~ believe in the Scrolls of Life. We believe that you are us and that we are you and that together we are one! Man, we are one with plants and animals, stars in the heavens, clouds in the atmosphere! We even have a safari vacuum that we use to abduct plants and animals so that they can join us in the circle of life."
 Bard
  "We, the ~race~ adhere to the Philosophy of Chance! It is not of our choice to follow strict rules. We follow our hearts, we're jolly as fools. But don't make us cross, or sour our mood, or before you know it, you'll be our next food.~p~Soon we will tell you what awaits you if you join us..."
  "We, the ~race~ follow the Philosophy of Chance! We don't march around aimlessly like an army of ants, nor do we all wear the same designer pants. Instead, we laugh and we sing and we all try to dance, while being very careful not to trample our plants.~p~Soon we will tell you what awaits you if you join us..."
  "We, the ~race~ are followers of the Philosophy of Chance! Our looks may be deceiving, but we are not normally a violent and war-like species. We enjoy the finer things in life, like food and drink and laughter. Why, just last month we had some friends over for dinner from a neighboring system. They were delicious!~p~Soon we will tell you what awaits you if you join us..."
 Zealot
  "We, the ~race~ are followers of the teachings of Spode and the Philosophy of Faith! We heard about you before you arrived here and quite honestly We cannot believe that you do not believe in the beliefs that We believe in! Unbelievable! "
  "We, the ~race~ adhere to the truth: the Philosophy of Faith! It behooves you to believe as we believe, because both you and I know that we, the ~race~ are right in what we believe! All hail, followers of Spode!"
  "We, the ~race~ follow the one, true Philosophy of Faith! Woe be to those who do not share our beliefs in the teachings of Spode, for they are wrong in the face of all that is right. If you were to repent now and admit your wrongness, we the ~race~ may take mercy upon you and help you to see the way of the Rightness!"
 Scientist
  "We, the ~race~ follow the Scrolls of Science.~p~It is our duty to study, dissect and examine the universe around us. We seek knowledge and it is our fervent belief that every question can be answered with research, systematic categorization, dedication and logic. Knowledge is our fuel and there is no higher calling than learning. Those who try to prevent us from our scholarship do so at their peril."
  "Come, my student. Learn about we, the ~race~, who subscribe to the Philosophy of Science. It is our duty to scrutinize those around us and to evaluate scientifically that which is not immediately apparent. The only truth is Science, not religion, not universality. Cold, hard fact. That is our Spode."
  "We, the ~race~ follow the Scrolls of Science.~p~We believe that the survival of the species is based on managing risk! How do you evaluate risk? Through study, careful examination! We are not in the business of following our whims! We have the power to research all life and the power to destroy life on a planet with a single Gravitation Wave, such is our super power."
 Trader
  "We, the ~race~ lay claim to the often-imitated, never-duplicated Philosophy of Prosperity. I'll have you know that it's merely the finest Philosophy in all the known Universe, the unknown Universe, and everything in between. The Philosophy of Prosperity teaches us the value of loyalty, honesty, happiness, and a well-written contract. After all, not even the Tablet of Prosperity can guarantee future performance based on past results."
  "Thanks to the Philosophy of Prosperity, we, the ~race~ love everything! We love our Empire, we love other Empires, we love happy people, we love unhappy people. But most of all we love our profit margins. And we love all the other things because they contribute to our margins!"
  " We, the ~race~ are a simple people, concerned with simple things. There's only one care we have in the world: following the Philosophy of Prosperity. A simpler Philosophy you will never find.~p~Just between you and me, the best parts are where the Tablet of Philosophy is talking about accounting methods. Of course there's also the chapter on calculating earnings potential. And who can forget those beautiful verses on the balance of trade, and the cost-benefit analysis of limited market segmentation. Maybe my favorite chapter is the analysis of the impact of solar-localized demand fluctuation on a pan-galactic Empire.~p~But yes, as someone of your observational prowess can clearly see, we ~race~ are a simple people with simple motives."
  "As members of the ~race~, we strongly believe in the Philosophy of Prosperity. It teaches us to mind our own business, and to mind it very well. There's no other Empire in the Universe that can compete with our levels of operational efficiency!~p~Although I must say, you look like a clever ~player_creature_name~, and I'll bet you're doing a heck of a job running your Empire, aren't you? Don't be modest, of course you are, or you wouldn't be here talking to me!~p~Only the smartest species in the Universe know to seek out the ~race~ for all their financial advisory needs. And only the smartest species in the Universe sign up for our training courses on the Philosophy of Prosperity. We also offer group discounts if you know any other Empires who want to learn the secrets of the Tablet of Prosperity. Sorry, no refunds."
 Shaman
  "Wise traveler. Learn all that you can, for there are many different true answers for life's questions. The beings of the ~race~ follow the Philosophy of Harmony. As such, we know that every species must find its own truth.~p~For the followers of Harmony, our touchstone is home. With our gift, we are able to teleport to our homeworld to reconnect with our terraself."
  "We, the ~race~, follow the Philosophy of Harmony. All beings can enter this Circle and harmonize with us.~p~This has given us the power of the Return Ticket. Once part of the Harmony, and from any place in the Universe, intone the Pure Syllable, and instantly one is transported back home."
  "We, the ~race~ are Philosophers of Harmony. Those who harmonize with us have found inner stillness where it begins: At home.~p~In addition to discovering our inner beauty, practicing Harmony grants the universal power of the Return Ticket. From all points in the Universe, those in Harmony can instantly teleport back home."
 Warrior
  "The ~race~ are strong and powerful. The Philosophy of Force is the only choice. All other philosophies are weak! ~p~Those that are strong enough to follow the Philosophy of Force will have the added power to call in a fighting force to attack their enemies."
  "~player_creature_name~ want to know what makes ~race~ into ~race~.~p~It is the Philosophy of Force! How has ~race~ survived? Always, others want to fight. Always, others want to take away! It is Force that helps ~race~ against the others. When they fight, we fight back, we fight better. We stand together until the fight is won. That is ~race~! That is the philosophy of Force.~p~When you know Force, you know that one is strong, but many are stronger.~p~Force will bring you help in your fights."
  "~player_creature_name~ ask about ~race~? ~player_creature_name~ ask about Force.~p~Force is like rock. Many storms pass over rock, but rock does not move. Rock is hard, rock is strong. Rock does not break. Other things break under rock! Rock crushes all.~p~We ~race~ are a field of rock. Always strong, and never one rock alone. If the enemy comes, we fight them together and do not break. If the enemy does not come, we bring our rock to the enemy... and crush them! That is the way of Force."
  "Ha! ~player_creature_name~ ask questions about ~race~. ~player_creature_name~ is nervous. ~player_creature_name~ is afraid. Afraid of the ~race~! Good. All species should fear the ~race~.~p~We follow the Philosophy of Force. We are strong and mighty, and our numbers are great. Force keeps us strong and brings us victory on the battlefield.~p~Tell me, who has more power than ~race~? Sometimes, others think that they are stronger. Each time, they are wrong. There is only one species that we cannot defeat, but you are not them."
  "We ~race~ know the Philosophy of Force. It is strength, and it is victory.~p~First, we were strongest among our neighbors. Then we were strongest in all our lands. Then we found new lands and new neighbors. We went there in great numbers, and we fought, and we were strongest there, too. And now we are the strongest of all empires... all empires but one.~p~If anyone dares challenge the ~race~, then we will fight. And we will win."
 Grob
  "What foolish mortal deigns to seek countenance with the all powerful and most extraordinary Grox? How dare you disgrace us with your meager and lackluster presence? We care not to breathe the self same air that you have poisoned with your noxious aura.~p~After I spend some time berating you, the expectation will be that you begin your exodus out of our system post haste. I feel the need to cleanse my very eyeball after having soiled my retina with the ghastly vision that is your form. Be gone oh foul and unsightly trespasser!~p~Don't let the gravitational pull of our planet hit you in the backside on your way out!"

Empire declines trade route (relationship too low):
 Diplomat
  "The Grand Council has decided that our interests do not yet coincide. We respectfully decline your proposal. "
  "The Grand Council concludes that our relations should improve before we embark on your ambitious proposal."
 Ecologist
  "We hesitate at this stage in our relationship to open our borders to your ships. Perhaps some other time."
  "We are uncertain of the impact of your citizens on our culture. We will have to know you better."
 Bard
  "We don't know if we want you around all the time! Sorry!"
  "Maybe you need to work a little on your relationship skills! Let's see if you can be useful in some other ways first!"
 Zealot
  "For now, Spode's faithful are uneasy at the presence of unbelievers. We shall have to know you better before we can accept."
  "We have asked Spode's guidance on the matter, and Spode has declined your offer. Perhaps Spode will be more favorable at a future date."
 Scientist
  "We find that there are too many unknowns involved. We decline your offer."
  "Our relationship has not yet progressed to the point where we can accept your offer. We must decline."
 Trader
  "We hate to turn down a chance for profit, but we feel we must. We know too little about you to begin a long-term relationship. "
  "Mutual trust is necessary before a large-scale trading venture can succeed! We don't know enough about you to make that commitment. Sorry!"
 Shaman
  "The Divination Crystals are against this idea. Sorry."
  "The Forty-Third Prophecy of Master Agpck told us that you would make this offer! Unfortunately, the prophecy also told us to decline!"
 Warrior
  "We do not yet know if you will make an honorable trading partner. We feel we must decline."
  "Your proposal is interesting, but our relationship must improve before we can allow your ships in our skies."
 Grob
  "No, this is unacceptable."
  "We decline. "
 Response 1
  "Okay."

Empire declines trade route (player has too many):
 Diplomat
  "The Grand Council has concluded that your current trade operations have you spread too thin. Feel free to contact us again when you're not so busy."
  "The Grand Council fears that trade with your Empire at this time wouldn't be prudent, you may contact us again."
 Ecologist
  "We had hoped for a more positive outcome, but we have to conclude that trade with your civilization is not yet worth the energy expenditure."
  "It looks like you've spent too many of your trade route points already. Any more and you'll bring harm to the galaxy.~p~We must preserve our galaxy's beauty.~p~We will pass."
 Bard
  "Woah, easy Trader McTraderton with all your big words and business deals.~p~We will have no trady trady with you. "
  "Though we find you personally attractive, your offer to do business we do not.~p~Party at our planet tomorrow. Bring a side dish. "
 Zealot
  "Spode's people are immune to the insignificant temptations that you offer us."
  "We must decline. We fear you are not fully committed to Spode's followers."
 Scientist
  "Good day ~player_title~ of the ~player_creature_name~.~p~Statistical data shows that your Empire is running trade at full capacity.~p~The only logical answer for us is to decline. Best of luck in the future."
  "~player_title~ of the ~player_creature_name~, it's good to be in your presence.~p~An interstellar trade pact requires foresight and commitment on the part of both parties. Our analyses suggest that you may not be capable of upholding your end of the bargain. Therefore, we decline."
 Trader
  "We hate to decline the opportunity to trade with someone as magnificent as yourself, but your current operations have you at capacity.~p~We respectfully decline your offer. "
  "We were very enthusiastic about this until we looked at the numbers... and the numbers never lie. There is no upside. Our money is best invested elsewhere, sorry."

  "We are too evolved an intelligence to engage in matters of materialism with one who feels materials matter so much.~p~We decline."
  "For your own good, we urge you to concentrate on higher matters and leave this materialism behind."
 Warrior
  "Your trade routes are already too many. Come back with a better offer, and we may reconsider."
  "Why do you suggest that we plunder your economy? Is this some kind of trick?"
 Grob
  "We decline."
  "Your proposal has no interest for us."

  "Okay, maybe when I have fewer trade routes."

Player ends trade route:
 Diplomat
  "As you wish. Our ships have ceased their departure from our ports. You will see our spice no more."
  "According to section 1.0004B of the Galactic Trade Embargo Agreement, you have every right to sever this trade agreement.~p~Let us know if you change your mind."
 Ecologist
  "You no longer care to share Spice resources with us? That's too bad, we will spread our resources to those more needy. "
  "Wow... this came out of nowhere...~p~This is probably a good thing. We don't want to exploit our planet's natural resources to exhaustion. "
 Bard
  "Fine! We didn't want to trade with you anyways.~p~Keep it together ~race~, don't cry in front of the customers.~p~Boohoohoo..."
  "You can't stop trading with us now. We need that Spice to pay for our annual Dance 'til you Drop party.~p~We've already put a deposit on the DJ. The caterer has already started making the Ziggs in a Blanket. Mmmhhh, those are good. "
 Zealot
  "Spode will not be pleased. We will pray for you. "
  "May you find peace with yourself after this decision. We will pray for you. "
 Scientist
  "This decision seems highly illogical. Maybe you will reconsider after coming to your senses."
  "All of the data shows this trade agreement as being highly profitable for both parties.~p~This doesn't compute."
 Trader
  "This is terrible news, simply terrible.~p~We value you as customer and hope that you reconsider.~p~Can you fill out a feedback slip?"
  "This is going to impact our upcoming profit reports. We wish you'd reconsider.~p~Who do we have to fire? "
 Shaman
  "It is said, 'All good things must come to an end.' It appears we have come to that end, friend. "
  "We shall part ways on good terms and high spirits. May the stars shine upon you. "

Trade route purchase ready:
 Diplomat
  "The Grand Council has decided to focus on a new set of economic priorities. In view of this fact, perhaps you would care to purchase our Star System ~star_name~?"
  "Administering our trade route jointly has become a managerial headache. Would you care to purchase the ~star_name~ system outright?"
  "The Grand Council has decided that our trade route has been developed to its full potential.  Perhaps you would care to purchase the ~star_name~ so that we can concentrate on other priorities?"
 Ecologist
  "We intend to concentrate on a series of new terraforming projects, and would like to raise the capital by selling you our Star System of ~star_name~. Would you be interested?"
  "Some of our settlement projects are taking longer to come to fruition than we expected.  Would you care to help us out by purchasing our Star System ~star_name~?"
  "When all is said and done, the profit motive isn't what we're about. Perhaps you'd like to own our Star System ~star_name~ outright?"
 Bard
  "We're running short of money to buy party supplies! Maybe you'd like to help us party down by purchasing our Solar System ~star_name~?"
  "The Fashion Festival exhausted our treasury, and the festival's only half over! We could keep our models on the runway if you'd buy Star System ~star_name~ from us!"
  "We overspent a little on the Festival of Building Extravagant Monuments to Ourselves.  If you bought the ~star_name~ System, we could fix our budget deficit!"
 Zealot
  "Spode's Plan calls for large, extravagant temples in every settlement. In order to afford this, we're willing to sell you the ~star_name~ System. Are you interested?"
  "Tithes have fallen short this year! Perhaps you'd be willing to aid us by purchasing the System ~star_name~"
  "Equipping our missionaries with lasers and bombs is proving more expensive than we anticipated.  Spode would thank you if you'd make up the deficit by purchasing our ~star_name~ System."
 Scientist
  "Analysis demonstrates that our trade route has reached maturity. We would like to devote our resources elsewhere. Would you care to purchase the ~star_name~ Star System from us?"
  "Our budget methodology has proven to be based on a faulty theory. Can you help us make up for the shortfall by purchasing the ~star_name~ Star System from us?"
  "We'd like to build our Huge Experimental Super-Colossaltron, but our funds are inadequate. Perhaps you'd care to invest in science by purchasing the ~star_name~ Star System from us?"
 Trader
  "Luckily for you, there's a Super Special Price on trade routes right now! Would you like to own the ~star_name~ Star System outright?"
  "We've got a terrific investment opportunity on the horizon, but we're short on liquidity! If you agreed to purchase ~star_name~ Star System, we could both make money and our mutual happiness would be assured!"
  "The sell-by date on our shipment of Gorb-Flatchers has expired, and now we have to suck up the loss! You could help us out by buying the ~star_name~ Star System from us!"
 Shaman
  "We need to raise money in order to purchase High-Power Spiritual Energy Crystals! Would you like to help us by purchasing the ~star_name~ Star System from us?"
  "The profits from our trade route are beginning to send disruptive vibrations that are threatening to cancel our non-materialist spiritual perfection! You can help us advance to the next plane by purchasing the ~star_name~ System once and for all. "
  "We went into a special sixteen-day meditation, and when we opened our eyes, someone had taken all our money! Can you aid us by buying the ~star_name~ Star System from us?"
 Warrior
  "We have our hearts set on purchasing some massive new Mega-Bombs! We could afford them if you'd purchase the ~star_name~ Star System from us."
  "Expensive new weapons systems have resulted in a budgetary shortfall. In consequence, we would be willing to sell you our ~star_name~ Star System. "
  "We hate soiling the purity of our warrior spirit through this endless accounting of the profits from our joint trade route. Would you take the ~star_name~ Star System from off our hands?"
 Grob
  "We need money in order to bribe another species to reckless acts of self-destruction. To this end you will purchase the ~star_name~ Star System."
  "The Grox wish you to purchase the ~star_name~ Star System. You will not disappoint us."
  "The Grox have grown tired of this tiresome trading. The Grox will take your money in exchange for the ~star_name~ System for which we no longer have use. It is best not to contemplate the consequences of refusal.~p~Report to the location of the exhausted route to terminate this transaction."

  "Our ally is welcome to make an offer, but bear in mind that our citizens will expect the offer to be a fair one."
  "This subject is not without interest. The Grand Council would like to know how their advantage is best served."
 Diplomat (Not Allied)
  "The Grand Council is open to suggestions from its friend ~player_title~, but we have a responsibility to our citizens not to let their hard work go unrewarded."
  "We will discuss any subject with our friend, but we would have to be strongly motivated in order to surrender sovereign territory."
 Ecologist (Allied)
  "We would be pleased to help our ally, if assurance were made concerning our own interests."
  "Our companions in the Universal Life Web are welcome to make an offer."
 Ecologist (Not Allied)
  "What you suggest is not impossible, but we would have to be adequately compensated for our investment in the system. "
  "We might consider this, if there were adequate safeguards for any native life-forms, and we were compensated for the investment of time and effort we have made in the system."
 Bard (Allied)
  "Anything for you, space-buddy! But maybe you can help us with the expenses of moving out...?"
  "We're totally flattered that you want our worlds, and we'd be even more flattered by a substantial offer."
 Bard (Not Allied)
  "But that star is one of our prettiest! But maybe we'll let it go if you agree to support the next several festivals..."
  "Normally we'd say no, but maybe if you help us make up a weeny little shortfall in our budget...?"
 Zealot (Allied)
  "~player_title~ may make an offer, and we will consult Spode's will on the matter."
  "It will require a donation to Spode's temple in order to confer his blessing on this transfer. Perhaps you would be willing to make this offering?"
 Zealot (Not Allied)
  "We dislike leaving a world once we have claimed it for Spode, but we are experiencing a deficit in the budget of our Military Missionaries. Perhaps you would help us fill it?"
  "That system has not been judged necessary for Spode's Plan, but we're not going to let it go for nothing."
 Scientist (Allied)
  "We would be happy to oblige you, but we expect a reasonable return."
  "We are willing to accommodate you, provided that adequate payment can be assured."

  "Let the sum reflect the true glory of your being!"
 Shaman (Allied)
  "The World Spirit suggests that it might be willing to shift to a new custodian. If you could just cover our expenses...?"
  "We are willing to break our worldly attachments to this star system, if sufficient worldly motivation is provided."
 Shaman (Not Allied)
  "We'd be willing to surrender control of the system to any sufficiently evolved civilization. But as ~player_creature_name~ are materialists, we'll have to settle for some of your material."
 Shaman
  "You wish to purchase a star system, and we wish to buy some expensive crystals to store our spiritual energies. Perhaps an equilibrium can be reached?"
 Warrior (Allied)
  "Let our honorable ally make a straightforward offer, and we will do our best to accommodate you."
  "We would be pleased to aid you in this matter, but we would have to recoup our substantial investments in the system."
 Warrior (Not Allied)
  "If our security were guaranteed, this exchange might be possible... and since security is best guaranteed by expensive weapons systems, perhaps you'd be willing to buy us some...?"

 Diplomat (Not Allied)
  "The Grand Council views your offer with interest, but the Finance Committee has concluded that it is a bit low."
  "This comes close to our requirements. Can you possibly offer more?"
 Ecologist (Allied)
  "Could you increase the offer a little, for the sake of our alliance?"
  "Your offer falls just a little short. Could you increase it?"
 Ecologist (Not Allied)
  "The sum does not quite meet our expectations."
  "Can you increase the offer to cover the cost of some carbon offsets?"
 Bard (Allied)
  "We were hoping to have enough to repaint our home world a gorgeous shade of magenta, but this falls a little short!"
  "Even if we chop up the offer, fire it into the sky on a rocket, and let it rain down as confetti, this offer is still just a little inadequate!"
 Bard (Not Allied)

  "Wow! That's really close! But the price is not yet right!"
 Zealot (Allied)
  "We have prayed on the matter, but Spode has told us to reject the offer. If you could increase the sum but a little, Spode might yet smile upon you."

  "You missed the target by a smidge! Can you bump it up a little?"
 Trader (Not Allied)

  "Your offer falls a bit short of the esteem in which we hold your magnificent self."
 Shaman (Allied)
  "Your fortunetellers failed to tell you the fortune we needed. Can you offer a little more?"
  "This offer almost meets the standard of material renunciation we expect in our allies! Can you renounce a little more for us, please?"
 Shaman (Not Allied)
  "This offer will buy almost all the power crystals we need! Can you possibly increase it?"
  "Two are not yet One. But if One increases the sum but a little, One may yet be One with Two."
 Warrior (Allied)
  "We have viewed our honorable ally's offer with great seriousness, but it falls a little short of our present needs."
  "Your offer does you credit, but it falls short of buying us the weapons systems we need. Could you increase it?"
 Warrior (Not Allied)
  "This does not quite cover our expenses in defending this system. If you could increase the amount slightly, we would accept it."

 Shaman (Not Allied)
  "This sum would hardly buy a single power crystal!"
  "No matter how long we chant over this offer, it still stinks. "
 Warrior (Allied)
  "It is only your status as an ally that prevents us from viewing this offer as an affront!"

 Warrior (Not Allied)

Empire requests payment to attack:
 Diplomat
  "Unfortunately, the Grand Council is all too aware of the financial burden this attack would impose on our citizens. Can you aid us with a grant of ~attack_cost~?"
  "A temporary fiscal shortfall makes it impossible to fully outfit our fleet. ~attack_cost~ would be required."
 Ecologist
  "Outfitting the fleet with bio-compatible weapons has left us without the money to fight the actual battle. Could you possibly donate ~attack_cost~?"
  "Maintaining a Green lifestyle in our war fleet is more expensive than we anticipated. Could you possibly help us to the extent of ~attack_cost~?"
 Bard
  "We're totally behind you in blowing the enemy to smithereens, but the last several festivals have left us stony broke! Could you possibly give us ~attack_cost~ for party supplies for the troops?"
  "We're ready for the attack, but first we need to build the fleet's morale with a huge party! It will cost ~attack_cost~."
 Zealot
  "The necessity of outfitting the fleet with a large contingent of missionaries and many copies of the complete works of Spode has exhausted our treasury. Could you possibly contribute ~attack_cost~ to Spode's Holy Cause?"

 Scientist
  "Our economic analysis of the attack seems to have slipped a few integers. Could you possibly donate ~attack_cost~?"

  "War fleets cost money! This one will cost you ~attack_cost~!"
 Shaman
  "Our highly-evolved non-materialist lifestyle has resulted in a shortage of, well, material. Could you possibly give us ~attack_cost~?"
  "We've been paying attention to spiritual advancement, not fiscal prudence! But if you gave us ~attack_cost~, we could still make this assault."
 Warrior
  "Our war fleet is prepared, but we must also consider the cost of defending the homeland while our fleet is away. Naturally our noble ally will not want to see our home worlds suffer, and will be willing to offer us ~attack_cost~."

Attack request declined (busy) (?):
 MySpecies
  "goodbye"
 Diplomat
  "We regret to report that we are facing a crisis of our own. The Grand Council would be grateful for your help."
 Ecologist
  "Unfortunately we are facing an emergency at the moment. Any help you can give us would be welcome. "
 Bard
  "We'd love to help you incinerate your foes, but alas, things have gone seriously awry here at the moment. Feel free to help us clean up!"
 Zealot
  "We would love to help you deal with Spode's enemies, but we are facing challenges of our own right now. Perhaps you would care to aid Spode's cause...?"
 Scientist
  "An analysis of the current situation reveals that we cannot conduct warfare and cope with our own crisis at the same time. Your aid in helping us manage the latter is solicited."
 Trader
  "We would love fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with beings as awesome as yourselves, but we're facing an emergency situation of our own right now! Can you aid us?"
 Shaman
  "We would like to kick some spiritually unevolved beings around the galaxy, but we've just become aware of an emergency here in our own civilization. You would gain many good karma points if you'd help us!"
 Warrior
  "It is a principle of warfare never to fight on two fronts. A new front has opened within our own realm. Perhaps our ally can help...?"
 Grob
  "No. Stand by for further orders."
 Response 1
  "I understand. One more thing before I go..."
 Response 2
  "Okay. Thanks for letting me know."

Attack request declined (current empire is already attacking):
 Diplomat
  "The Grand Council is pleased to report that this target is already under assault."
 Ecologist
  "Our fleet is already attacking that world."
 Bard
  "Wow! It's like our minds are totally in synch! Our own Paisley Task Force is already assaulting that target!"
 Zealot
  "Spode's Holy Warriors have attacked that world already, and soon will claim the target for the forces of righteousness!"
 Scientist
  "Our strategists have confirm your analysis of the tactical situation, and issued their recommendations some time ago. Our fleet is already on the attack in that quadrant."
 Trader
  "We have anticipated your magnificent strategic thought! Our forces are already on the attack!"
 Shaman
  "Before you arrived, Guru P'tang sensed your intentions through the luminiferous aether, and our ships are already attacking that target!"
 Warrior
  "Our ships have already been sent to crush that planet."
 Grob
  "You do not need to tell us what to do. Our ships already struck that world."
 Response 1
  "Okay. Good to know that."

Attack request declined (other empire is already attacking):
 Diplomat
  "Our scouts have reported to the Grand Council that the target is already under attack."
 Ecologist
  "Our sensors indicate that life-forms are under threat in that system. An attack is in progress! "
 Bard
  "Someone anticipated you, star-buddy! That system is already being trashed!"
 Zealot
  "One of our scouts, freshly martyred, has informed us that the system is already under attack."
 Scientist
  "Analysis of spectra strongly suggests that this system is already being attacked."
 Trader
  "We've encountered refugees who have informed us that this system is already under assault!"
 Shaman
  "Our revered Seer Qrooorlo went into a trance and told us that an attack was already in progress."
 Warrior
  "Scout vessels report that the system is already being attacked."
 Grob
  "You are too late. The system is already under assault."
 Response 1
  "Okay. Thanks for the information."

Attack request declined (out of range):
 Diplomat
  "The Grand Council regrets to report that this target is beyond the range of our fleet."
 Ecologist
  "That would be sending our ships too far from home."
 Bard
  "You want us to go all that enormous distance, just to fight a battle? No way!"
 Zealot
  "Zeal in the service of Spode is not enough to send our ships all that way."
 Scientist
  "Unfortunately, you ask the impossible. Our fleet does not have sufficient range."
 Trader
  "We would be delighted to help your excellence, but that target is beyond our range."
 Shaman
  "Even with our Extra-Power Magic Space Crystals, our ships can't travel that far!"
 Warrior
  "We would be delighted to oblige our honorable ally, but our fleet lacks sufficient range."
 Grob
  "It would weaken our blockade to send our forces that distance."
 Response 1
  "Thanks anyway."

Empire accepts alliance:
 Diplomat
  "The Grand Council is gratified to accept the offer of alliance."
  "The Grand Council is pleased to have a firm friend among the stars. The offer is accepted."
 Ecologist
  "It is good to have found a kindred spirit in the Galactic Live Web. We are pleased to become your ally."
  "We accept your offer of alliance. Let us expand the Universal Life Web together!"
 Bard
  "Absolutely, space-buddy! As far as we're concerned, you're Numero Uno! "
  "Let's hitch our space-ships in tandem, and party till the stars die out!"
 Zealot
  "Spode blesses the idea of an alliance."
  "We call upon Spode to witness the terms of our alliance."
 Scientist
  "It seems reasonable to conclude an alliance at this time. "
  "You have proven yourself worthy to become our ally. We accept your offer."
 Trader
  "It has long been our wish to become an ally of your glorious self. Let the alliance prosper!"
  "With this alliance, we can bring happiness to the galaxy! We accept your offer."
 Shaman
  "We've consulted the entrails on this matter, and now that we've washed up, we're happy to report that the entrails say yes!"
  "We've cast the runes, and they say we're karmically linked!"
 Warrior
  "You are a suitable ally. We are pleased to accept."
  "Your honorable behavior marks you out for special favor. We will be your ally."
 Grob
  "We accept the offer of alliance, provided that you continue to accept our orders."
  "We shall permit you to be our ally, as long as it suits us."
 Response 1
  "Okay, well lemme ask you something else."
  "Can I ask about something else?"
  "I have another question."
  "There is something else I'd like to discuss."
 Response 2
  "Yeah, I'm pumped. This is gonna be epic!"
  "I'm looking forward to a long partnership."
  "Things are looking on the up and up!"
  "Yesssss. Who will stop us now? Muwhahahah!"

Empire rejects alliance:
 Diplomat
  "Hey, no offense, but we just don't know you well enough to say whether or not you can be trusted. Maybe a little quid pro quo would help. Do something for us, and we'll be a lot more likely to ally our race with your own."
  "No, it's not gonna happen. The universe has a strict pecking order, and we can't be seen with you."
 Ecologist
  "Let's take this slow, we barely know you.~p~We have a few tasks for you first. It will help us to better acquaint our two species."
  "Whoa, take our foot off the hyperdrive pedal.~p~You'll need to earn our trust."
 Bard
  "Bwahahaha! You want to make an alliance? Bwahahaha!~p~Oh you're serious?~p~Let's see how serious you really are. "
  "We never party with aliens we don't know.~p~That's like party school 101.~p~Tell ya what, if you take care of a few errands for us, we might be interested."
 Zealot
  "In the book of Varzmir, sage of the great mountain, it is said never to enter partnership without knowing one's own partner.~p~Shall you serve Spode well, we may consider."
  "We could never enter partnership with one so uncleansed.~p~Will you seek cleansing?"
 Scientist
  "We're sorry ~player_title~ of the ~player_creature_name~ race. We cannot enter a binding treaty with your people at this time.~p~Maybe in the future."
  "We must decline your offer ~player_title~ of the ~player_creature_name~ race.~p~We are far too busy with our experiments to enter an allegiance with you.~p~Maybe if you assist us with our studies. "
 Trader
  "We are sorry, but we cannot agree to form an alliance with your great race at this time.~p~Our business has us far too busy.~p~We may reconsider if you can help us out. "
  "We appreciate the offer, but we must respectfully decline oh great one.~p~If it wouldn't be too much to ask, maybe you could assist us with a few tasks. If you're not too busy of course. "
 Shaman
  "It is said, ' The moon of Jodor cannot align with the planet of Vanktar 7 without the help of the Eastern Winds.'~p~Be our Eastern Winds and we may change our minds."
  "A candle without a flame cannot light a room. Before we can be your flame, we must ask that you prove yourself. "
 Warrior
  "You must prove yourself worthy of our respect before we enter alliance with you. "
  "The ~race~ cannot enter alliance with one who has not proven themselves honorable.~p~Prove your strength and then we can talk about forming a life bond. "
 Grob
  "An alliance with The Grox?~p~You are barely worthy to be in our presence."
  "Silence! We will not talk of alliances until you have succumbed to our ways."
 Response 1
  "I will do what it takes to prove my worth to you."
  "I'm going to make sure whatever needs to happen, happens."
  "I'm going to make sure this alliance happens, whatever it takes."
  "What can I do to show you my commitment?"
 Response 2
  "Man, the universe is no picnic, sometimes."
  "The universe. She is a cruel mistress."
  "That's harsh, dude. I guess I gotta do what I gotta do."
  "Yeah, okay, okay. I see how it's gotta be."
  "So that's how it's going down? Okay, I see."

Empire rejects alliance (mission in progress):
 Diplomat
  "The Grand Council will be pleased to consider this matter once you have completed the mission you offered to undertake on our behalf."
  "Our records show that you have failed to complete a mission for which you volunteered. The matter of the alliance is postponed until after completion of the mission."
 Ecologist
  "We might view this with favor... if you would complete the mission you set out to perform."
  "We recall that you had once promised to complete an assignment for us. If this task is completed, we might consider the matter of alliance."
 Bard
  "Our rapidly deteriorating brain cells seem to recall that you once promised to undertake a mission for us. We can't talk about more serious matters till this mission is done!"
  "Whoa, space-buddy! Not so fast! When can we expect you to complete the assignment you said you were going to perform for us?"
 Zealot
  "Spode sees all and knows all. He will remember that you have failed to complete a mission you were to undertake on his behalf. No alliance can be contemplated until the mission is completed."
  "Your application for an alliance cannot be considered at this time. Spode's Children want only allies who keep their word. As we recall, you had offered to undertake a mission on our behalf, and this mission remains incomplete. "
 Scientist
  "Perhaps your memory fails you. You had offered to undertake a task on our behalf, and the task remains incomplete. We may reconsider once this mission is complete."
  "It seems irrational to accept as an ally someone who is notoriously unreliable, and who promised to perform a mission which remains incomplete."
 Trader
  "We're still waiting for the profits from the mission you said you'd perform! Once that's complete, we can discuss other matters."
  "We believe in spreading happiness about the galaxy with our friends, but we're still a little depressed about that mission you said you'd perform. Finish that, and we'll talk!"
  "Tell you what - you do that favor for us - the one we talked about. You do that, and we'll happily team up with you."
 Shaman
  "We can't possibly have an ally with bad karma, and you've brought bad karma on yourself by failing to complete an assignment for us! Finish that, and we'll consult the Seeing Stone about the alliance."
  "Sayeth the Prophet: 'Them what faileth to complete a mission will live friendless and alone.' You don't think the Prophet was talking about you, do you?"
 Warrior
  "We would never consider an alliance with someone who will not keep his word. Didn't you promise to complete a mission for us?"
  "It is impossible to speak of alliance until such time as you have completed the task you volunteered to undertake."
 Grob
  "Clearly machine minds remember better than watery bags of neurons. Did you not offer to complete a mission on our behalf? Is this mission incomplete?"
  "We will not ally with one whose mission is incomplete."
 Response 1
  "Let's talk about my mission."
  "Could you explain my mission again?"
  "Let's go over my mission again."
  "Let's talk about my mission."
 Response 2
  "Man, the universe is no picnic, sometimes."
  "The universe. She is a cruel mistress."
  "That's harsh, dude. I guess I gotta do what I gotta do."
  "Yeah, okay, okay. I see how it's gotta be."
  "So that's how it's going down? Okay, I see."

Empire requests alliance:
 Diplomat
  "The Grand Council would be honored if you would consent to join us in an alliance."
  "The Grand Council views you as a reliable friend. Would you be interested in a formal alliance?"
  "The Grand Council has decided that the galaxy would be a safer, more secure place if our two civilizations were allied. Do you agree?"
 Ecologist
  "We have been impressed by your commitment to the Galactic Life Web. Would you be interested in an alliance?"
  "We're worried about an eventual confrontation with the Grox. Would becoming our ally interest you?"
  "You have shown yourself a capable steward of many different biomes. We would like you to agree to become our ally."
 Bard
  "You're our best space-buddy ever! Let's become allies, and hope the party never dies!"
  "You are so totally our BFF! Let's make it official with an alliance! "
  "Let's pop the corks on our favorite fizzy juice, and become allies! What d'you say?"
 Zealot
  "After a long period of meditation and prayer, we find that Spode has inspired us make an offer of alliance."
  "Let us become allies, and let Spode's will be done."
  "The word of Spode would more easily be spread through the galaxy if you would consent to become our ally. Will you help Spode's people in this?"
 Scientist
  "You have demonstrated your commitment to reason and progress. Would it interest you to become our ally?"
  "It seems reasonable at this point that we become allies."
  "Let us become allies, and seek to bring order and enlightenment to the galaxy."
 Trader
  "We're all about happiness, and we'd be totally happy if you'd agree to be our ally!"
  "It has always been our ambition to ally with beings as glorious and awesome as yourselves. Would you agree to an alliance?"
  "If we became allies, we could establish a Totally For Profit Zone in our corner of the galaxy! Let's talk merger!"
 Shaman
  "Our fortune cookie at lunch said it was a good time to make friends, so we thought we'd ask if you'd be interested in an alliance!"
  "Teacher Bguz said that we were friends in a former life. It seems as if we're destined to be allies!"
  "It's clear that we're karmically linked! Let's become allies, and go on a galactic spirit quest together!"
 Warrior
  "You have demonstrated honorable behavior, and accordingly we offer to elevate you by making you our allies."
  "You have earned our esteem, and we are interested in your becoming our ally."
  "Our mutual security will be greatly enhanced if we become allies. Do you agree? "
 Grob
  "We desire an alliance with you. Refusal is not an option"
  "It suits us for you to become our allies immediately. "
  "We order you to form an alliance with us. "
 Response 1
  "Send Agreement to Alliance"
 Response 2
  "Send Rejection to Alliance"

Player breaks alliance:
 Diplomat
  "Well, that was unfortunate. I'm sorry it had to play out like that."
  "I don't feel good about how this went down, but I guess our alliance was always tenuous at best. I'm sorry things didn't work out."
  "The Grand Council regrets your decision."
 Ecologist
  "We're sorry that it didn't work out. We will reflect on this to see where our paths began to part."
 Bard
  "Man, I thought we were in this together. You were like a gestational pod-mate to me! I feel so betrayed!"
  "Really? Is it something we said?"
 Zealot
  "Alliance with an unbeliever was always a risk. Goodbye."
 Scientist
  "If data suggests that the alliance is no longer useful, then we should bring it to an end."
 Trader
  "I'm sorry that we had to part like this. Please don't hurt us. "
  "We're sorry you feel that way, but we hope you'll still visit our boutique!"
 Shaman
  "The sage Fratfrt predicted this action in his Forty-Forth Quatrain!"
 Warrior
  "You have acted honorably in informing us of this decision."
 Grob
  "Wha...? Oh... well OF COURSE you do! You finally realized that our vast superiority to your race made for an extremely awkward alliance! In fact, we were going to break the alliance with you first, earlier this morning! We just were busy... doing... stuff.~p~Fine! We don't need your alliance anyway. It's not like you were paying any dues or anything! There are hundreds of other races out there who would *love* to be in allegiance with us. Hahaha! The Grox needs nothing! Except maybe our CDs... and that red hooded sweater you also borrowed... and maybe the lava lamp in the bedroom... but other than that, we need NOTHING!~p~Now be gone from our sight!"
 Response 1
  "Okay, well lemme ask you something else."
  "Can I ask about something else?"
  "I have another question, then."
  "There is something else I'd like to discuss."
 Response 2
  "These things happen. Let's not dwell."
  "Easy come. Easy go."
  "Aww, do we have to make such a big deal out of this?"
  "Hey, no hard feelings. Take care."

Empire declares war:
 Diplomat
  "The Grand Council declares war!"
  "You will regret your defiance of the Grand Council. We are at war!"
  "The Grand Council sees no alternative but to declare war on your species!"
 Ecologist
  "Your materialist civilization will no longer be tolerated. We're at war!"
  "In order to prevent further damage to the Universal Life Web, we must declare war on your species!"
  "We've had enough of your non-life-affirming attitudes. We're at war!"
 Bard
  "We're totally at war now! Let the party begin!"
  "We're going to eradicate your civilization! Wheeeee!"
  "We're going to turn your species into highly entertaining piles of charred carbon!"
 Zealot
  "You have defied the Will of Spode for the last time! We are at war!"
  "The War of Spodification has begun! Die, unbelievers!"
  "Spode commands us to eradicate all unbelievers! We are at war!"
 Scientist
  "It is only rational to conclude that only a single civilization can dominate the galaxy, and that this species should be us.  Let the war begin!"
  "Your species is too illogical and mindless to survive! Prepare for extermination!"
  "We've had our fill of you and your inanities! It's war!"
 Trader
  "We're running a bit of a deficit, so we're going to kill all of you and loot your civilization! It's war!"
  "The galaxy isn't about to give you a free lunch! We're at war!"
  "We want your money! And your planets! And your cities! It's war!"
 Shaman
  "Your species is preventing the galaxy from advancing spiritually! We're going to eradicate you!"
  "We had a Warrior Weekend that was a big success- so now we're going to beat some drums, walk the Path of War, and wipe out your species!"
  "We're going to send you to your next incarnation! It's war!"
 Warrior
  "We are now at war. Don't take it personally- if it wasn't us eradicating you, it would be someone else. "
  "We have decided to field-test our new weapons systems- on your planets! We are now at war."
  "Let a thousand flowers bloom- and to explain the metaphor, the flowers are bombs, bursting above your cities. We're at war!"
 Grob
  "We are now at war! Exterminate! Exterminate!"
  "We are now at war. The eradication of your species will go more efficiently if you do not resist."
  "You are now at war with the Grox. Resistance is futile!"
 Response 1
  "Close Transmission"

Empire surrenders system:
 MySpecies
  "This star and all of its planets are yours, just give us the chance to pack our things and leave."
 Diplomat
  "Cease your attack, and we will evacuate this system and leave it to you."
  "We reluctantly conclude that it is hopeless to continue the fight. We will surrender this system if you permit us to leave unharmed."
 Ecologist
  "In order to spare our worlds further devastation, we will agree to surrender this system if you will order your forces to stand down."
  "Your superior technology has won the day. We will leave this system to you if you will allow us to evacuate in peace."
 Bard
  "All right, you big bully! We'll agree to leave if you'll agree to stop shooting!"
  "Your big lasers and stern martial prowess have won the day! If you'll give us enough time to pack a few of our things, we'll leave the planet to you!"
 Zealot
  "Spode has decreed for us a time of trial. We will abandon the system if you will agree to stop shooting."
  "The ways of Spode are ineffable. He has decreed your triumph. If you will permit us to evacuate in peace, you may have the system and all that is in it."
 Scientist
  "It is only reasonable to conclude that we have lost the battle. If you will stop your attack, we will evacuate and leave the system to you."
  "Your tactics have proven superior. If you will agree to a brief suspension of hostilities, we will cease our resistance and surrender this world."
 Trader
  "You need not continue to prove your magnificence! If you'll agree to a cease-fire, we'll abandon the system and leave everything to you!"
  "Stop, stop! If you'll agree to suspend the war, we'll evacuate and abandon our property!"
 Shaman
  "Your ruthless materialist philosophy has won the day! If you will agree to a halt in your aggression, we will evacuate our survivors and leave the system to you."
  "You're going to get a ton of bad karma for this! But your karmic burden may be lightened if you agree to a cease-fire so that we can peacefully abandon this system."
 Warrior
  "It must be admitted that your tactics were superior. If you will agree to a cease-fire, we will cease our resistance and leave this system to you."
  "You have learned well, warrior! We will leave this system to you, if you will agree to a cease-fire."
 Grob
  "Grox surrender. Does not compute. "
 Response 1
  "I claim this place."
 Response 2
  "I'd rather destroy what's left than let you escape!"

Empire surrenders war:
 MySpecies
  "We surrender! Please, we cannot rival your might. Take your spoils and leave us be, we beg of you!"
 Diplomat
  "The Grand Council has decided that our best option is to surrender."
  "We come to you in hopes that you will accept our surrender."
 Ecologist
  "In order to spare the environment further damage, we now offer to surrender."
  "This war has gone on long enough. We will surrender."
 Bard
  "Okay! You get the award for 'Meanest Culture in the Galaxy.' We give up! "
  "We all have a big party to attend, so we thought we'd save everyone time and surrender."
 Zealot
  "It is Spode's will that we hang on the brink of ruin! We will surrender, if you will spare what's left of us!"
  "We must preserve what is left! If you will spare Spode's Children, we will agree to surrender."
 Scientist
  "Available data suggests that it is futile to continue the conflict. We therefore offer to surrender."
  "Further resistance would seem to be useless. Will you accept our surrender?"
 Trader
  "Stop! Will you accept our surrender before you destroy the remains of our trade goods?"
  "No more shooting! We will surrender if you'll leave us the modest wealth that remains!"
 Shaman
  "Our spiritual superiority has not helped us in this struggle! We offer to surrender!"
  "We can't hold out long enough for you to be crushed beneath the weight of your own karma! We surrender!"
 Warrior
  "Your forces have fairly won the day. We offer honorable surrender."
  "Your tactics have been surprisingly effective. We offer surrender."
 Grob
  "Grox surrender? Does not compute. "
 Response 1
  "Yes, let there be peace."
 Response 2
  "No, I think I'd gain more from your destruction."

Begin peace offering:
 MySpecies
  "You think that money can solve this problem? Hmm... That could be."
 Diplomat
  "It is only fair that those in the wrong offer reparations. The Grand Council suggests great generosity."
  "The Grand Council does not alter its principles, but for the sake of clarity we ask you to elucidate your offer."
 Ecologist
  "We value life, not cash, but as you are a materialist culture, perhaps depriving you of money will serve as punishment enough. How much do you offer?"
  "Money may serve to help repair the damage you have caused. How much?"
 Bard
  "You'd better offer enough to cover the costs of the Peace Festival and several stylish new outfits!"
  "But we're having such fun blowing you to bits! You'd have to offer lots of money to divert us from our sport!"
 Zealot
  "Spode does not make peace so easily. But perhaps if the tithe were large enough...?"
  "We might consider this sincere atonement if the sum were large enough to cause you genuine pain."
 Scientist
  "We may consider peace, but only if your offer is sufficient."
  "We require that the offer be equitable."
 Trader
  "You can absolutely change our minds with a big enough bribe! How much?"
  "You'd have to compensate us in full for the loot we'd otherwise plunder from your worlds!"
 Shaman
  "We despise your offer of material compensation, but we suppose that if you suffer financial loss, it's only the forces of karma at work. How much do you offer the Lords of Karma?"
  "Material possessions are choking your Higher Self. How much are you willing to sacrifice?"
 Warrior
  "On one end of the balance, we despise your offer of cash as a means of settling this dispute. On the other end, we'd like to be able to pay for new weapons systems. We counsel tilting the balance with a weighty substance such as gold."
  "We would expect an offer of money from one who does not understand honor. Yet... as you have no honor... you can scarcely offer anything else. How much?"
 Grob
  "Peace means nothing to The Grox. "
 Response 1
  "~peace_offer_5~"
 Response 2
  "~peace_offer_4~"
 Response 3
  "~peace_offer_3~"
 Response 4
  "~peace_offer_2~"
 Response 5
  "~peace_offer_1~"
 Response 6
  "Nevermind. War is perhaps the less expensive alternative."

Peace offering declined (weak):
 MySpecies
  "Haha! Nice try, but you'll have to better than that to soothe our rage."
 Diplomat
  "The Grand Council does not consider this sum to be entirely adequate."
  "This offer of reparations does not quite meet our standards."
 Ecologist
  "This sum does not compensate us for our pain and suffering."
  "While we find the idea of reparations adequate in principle, this sum is inadequate in practice."
 Bard
  "At last you have our attention! Unfortunately this sum won't keep our attention for long."
  "We're sorry, but this amount won't quite pay for all the weapons we've been blasting you with!"
 Zealot
  "We are willing to give you credit for sincerity, but the sum is inadequate."
  "Spode requires a larger tithe."
 Scientist
  "Your reasoning is not far off the mark, but it still falls short."
  "A cost-benefit analysis shows that this offer does not fully compensate us for our efforts."
 Trader
  "The sum had us sitting up and taking notice! But our attention is wandering again- can you offer more?"
  "Not bad for a first offer! We'll look forward to your second!"
 Shaman
  "This sum is not quite enough to sway us from the Path of the Spirit Warrior."
  "We've checked with the Oracle, and she says, 'Ask for more!'"
 Warrior
  "This may pay for an ordinary weapons system, but we want the one with all the options! Make a better offer!"
  "This is not enough to compensate for the joy of annihilating you!"
 Grob
  "Money means nothing to The Grox."
 Response 1
  "I'll keep that in mind."

Peace offering declined (strong):
 MySpecies
  "This paltry sum isn't even close! With this pathetic offering, you've done nothing but give us more reason to crush you."
 Diplomat
  "The Grand Council urges you to reconsider this paltry offer."
  "The Grand Council considers this sum grossly inadequate."
 Ecologist
  "This insignificant sum shows that you aren't serious about the peace!"
  "This sum will barely suffice to plant a tree! "
 Bard
  "This is a joke! Right? Right?"
  "We totally applaud your ability to deliver a laugh line right in the middle of a desperate struggle for your own existence! But we're not going to stop shooting until you get a lot more serious."
 Zealot
  "Do you think a tiny sum such as this can restrain Spode's Holy Warriors?"
  "You insult us with this ridiculous sum!"
 Scientist
  "Your analysis of the situation seems faulty. Such an insignificant offering will not tempt us."
  "This tiny sum is in itself evidence of your defective reasoning skills."
 Trader
  "Get serious! We'd earn lots more by plundering you!"
  "Don't try to lowball us when we're pointing guns at you!"
 Shaman
  "Not only do you assume that we'd want your filthy money, but now you try to cheat us! "
  "We're only interested in helping you to achieve spiritual Oneness through sacrifice of material goods. This sacrifice is ridiculously small- and you want Oneness, don't you?"
 Warrior
  "We scorn this ridiculous sum!"
  "Your offer is deeply inadequate! Fight on, or impoverish yourself further!"
 Grob
  "Money means nothing to The Grox."
 Response 1
  "Oops. We may have miscalculated."

Peace offering success (weak):
 MySpecies
  "Ah, very well. We will let this offering appease us for now."
 Diplomat
  "The Grand Council is pleased to accept your offer."
  "The Grand Council finds your offer adequate. Let there be peace between our peoples."
 Ecologist
  "This will compensate us adequately for the destruction and expense of the war. "
  "We are a peaceful people by nature, and will accept this offer in token of the future friendship between our species."
 Bard
  "This is enough for a totally awesome weekend! The peace is on, space-buddy!"
  "With this money, we can all have fantastic new outfits! Let's give peace a chance!"
 Zealot
  "In exchange for this money, the Warrior of Spode will withhold their wrath... for now."
  "The tithe is adequate. Let there be peace."
 Scientist
  "Our analyses coincide. Let us settle our differences."
  "For once, your conclusions are rational. Let there be peace."
 Trader
  "That is a completely adequate sum! Let's be friends! And don't forget that we'd like you even more if you bought some of our merchandise!"
  "We'll take the money! And we'll take even more, if you visit the boutique!"
 Shaman
  "In order to benefit your Higher Selves, we will relieve you of the karmic burden of this money. There shall be peace between us."
  "We assure you that after we chant over this money to remove its bad karma, we will use the sum only for spiritually elevated purposes!"
 Warrior
  "To the victor belong the spoils! It would be wise for you never to tempt us again to your destruction."
  "We are honored to crush your forces, ravage your planets, take your money, and proclaim a victory."
 Grob
  "What is peace? Grox will cease destruction of current target, temporarily. "
 Response 1
  "What a relief!"

Peace offer accepted (strong):
 MySpecies
  "Oh my, yes! I'm quite certain you won't have any trouble with us now. Quite generous of you!"
 Diplomat
  "Your astounding generosity shall be rewarded by immediate peace."
  "The reparations are beyond our expectations. The Grand Council shall ratify the peace instantly."
 Ecologist
  "This sum is sufficient to turn a dozen worlds green! Let there be peace between us!"
  "With such a vast sum, you have truly renounced your materialist ethic! "
 Bard
  "Now we've got to be careful so that we don't get crushed by great big wads of money falling from the sky! Let's have peace... especially now that we're too rich to do any fighting!"
  "Thanks to your astounding generosity, we'll be able to afford the new fashion for solid collidium fixtures in our homes!"
 Zealot
  "We did not expect such a generous atonement. With this, you show yourself genuinely repentant."
  "Spode must have moved your heart to this extraordinary contribution! In his name, we accept this proposal of peace."
 Scientist
  "Our analysis suggests that you must be seriously deranged to give us this much money. Nevertheless, we accept."
  "We accept both your offer of peace, and this colossal extravagance of a gift."
 Trader
  "WAHOOO!!! WE'LL TAKE IT!!! WE'RE RICH!!! WE'RE RICH!!! WE'RE RICH!!!"
  "If we'd known you had that much money, we would have declared war earlier!"
 Shaman
  "By giving away this colossal sum, you have taken your first step toward spiritual wisdom."
  "As spiritually advanced beings, we will be far better custodians of this vast and unexpected sum than you. You may have your peace. "
 Warrior
  "You must have been insane with terror to offer us this much! We take the money, and advise you to remain terrified."
  "This sum will pay for weapons systems beyond our wildest imaginings! We'll take the money! And the guns! And the bombs! And the rockets...!"
 Grob
  "What is peace? Grox will cease destruction of current target, temporarily. "
 Response 1
  "Let there be peace at any price."

  "You have entered the territory of ~race~. We hope our relationship will be fruitful."
  "You have entered space under our control. All peaceful species are welcome."
 Bard (Annoyed)
  "Normally we have to consume a lot of juice before we see something like you!"
  "Don't you know it's not polite to enter without knocking?"
  "Who said you could crash the party?"
 Bard (Neutral)
  "You're welcome to our territory! Please try to be amusing!"
  "Excuse me, but you seem to be wandering around in our territory. Are you lost?"
  "We were just thinking we needed a new species to play with, and here you are! What an interesting coincidence!"
 Zealot (Annoyed)
  "Be prepared to bow before the might of Spode!"
  "What are you doing here, unbeliever?"
  "Explain your presence among Spode's Chosen!"

 Trader (Annoyed)

  "You're trespassing! I hope you're ready to pay the fine!"
 Trader (Neutral)
  "Welcome, stranger! Did you bring money?"
  "You're in our territory! And luckily for you, we have a lot of things on sale!"
  "Why wander around in the darkness when you can come in and buy something?"
 Shaman (Annoyed)

 Warrior (Neutral)
  "You are in our security zone. Who are you, and why are you here?"
  "You now have an astonishing amount of weaponry pointed at you. Fortunately, we're more in the mood for talking."
  "Do you come in peace? If not, you are in for a life-changing experience."
 Grob (Annoyed)
  "You have violated the territory of the Grox. Explain why you should not be destroyed."
  "You are within our security zone. We have destroyed entire civilizations for less."
  "Halt! The Grox demand to know why you are here!"
 Grob (Neutral)
  "You have come into a prohibited zone. Explain yourself."
  "You have reached the territory of the Grox. Speak the truth, and it will go better for you."
  "The Grox give you permission to speak."

First greetings:
 Diplomat (Annoyed)
  "You are in the security zone of the ~race~. The Grand Council requires that you state your business."
  "The Grand Council wishes to know what you are doing here."
  "The Grand Council views your existence with grave concern."
 Diplomat (Neutral)
  "Greetings. Your ship is not in our data records.~p~What is your identification and registration information?"
  "Hello, most welcome visitor. Please present your documents and requisite approval forms."
  "The Grand Council of the ~race~ greets you.~p~We are pleased to make the acquaintance of another intelligent species. May we have your information and documentation please?"
 Ecologist (Annoyed)
  "We stand ready to guard the Universal Life Web from despoilers such as you."
  "Nature is our guide, and to us you seem unnatural."
  "We are the ~race~. We stand against your aggression and your unnatural lifestyle."
 Ecologist (Neutral)
  "We see that the well of nature... flowing with life force of all things... has produced another intelligent species. Greetings!~p~In the ~race~, we believe that a place for all exists within the Galactic Life Web. Live in harmony with nature, and we can make our journeys together. What may we call you friend?"
  "Wondrous well... new life presents itself to the ~race~... most welcome are you... What are you called?"
  "Welcome... dear fellow life form... it's nice just to enjoy each other, isn't it... Let's savor this moment...~p~What may we call you?"
  "Welcome... dear fellow life form... it's nice just to enjoy each other, isn't it... Let's savor this moment...~p~What may we call you?"
 Bard (Annoyed)
  "Shall we eat you now?"
  "What are you boring little people doing here, exactly?"
  "You're giving us a splitting headache! "
 Bard (Neutral)
  "Are you Food?"
  "We are the ~race~.~p~You are not, but we hope you're at least amusing."
  "Ho! The universe has tossed up another new species, still wet from the egg!~p~We think you're cute! Can we play with you?"
  "Are you Food?"
  "O, the glorious heavens shine their countenance upon the ~race~! Another alien society has deemed us worthy of first contact! This is truly the most auspicious of occasions! We shall sup on the finest and most fragrant foods! We shall sing! We shall dance, and make merry!~p~And lastly, we shall scrapbook furiously, so that future generations may know of this great day!"
 Zealot (Annoyed)
  "We in the ~race~ have accepted the Word of Spode, and you have not. What could we possibly have in common?"
  "Our civilization sings the praises of Spode, who brought us truth and enlightenment. You, however, remain in darkness. What do you want with us?"
  "Unless you accept the Word of Spode, we are not destined to walk in harmony. "
 Zealot (Neutral)
  "Hold. The magnificent ~race~, followers of the truth, crusaders of right, will consider your character.~p~Who do you present yourself to be?"
  "Halt in the name of the ~race~. All travelers must submit for inspection of fortitude.~p~State your name and be known to the supreme ~race~. "
  "Unenlightened visitor. You are in the presence of the planet of the mighty ~race~.~p~Who do you presume yourself to be and the ~race~ will consider you."
 Scientist (Annoyed)
  "We are the ~race~. Perhaps you would volunteer to be dissected?"
  "We in the ~race~ are devoted to the pursuit of knowledge and reason. We're not sure you meet this standard, however."
  "You're an interesting specimen. We'd like to see you on a slab."
 Scientist (Neutral)
  "Fascinating alien life form. What are you called?"
  "Curious DNA structure. Are you able to speak?"
  "Ah, another undocumented species. Wonderful. Do give us your information."
  "In the name of reason, we send you greetings.~p~In the ~race~, we subject all propositions to the light of observation, experimentation, and hard empirical truth. The universe provides its own answers to those clever enough to find them.~p~May we aid you on your task of discovery?"
 Trader (Annoyed)
  "We are disturbed that a being of your splendor notices us at all. Why don't you go away?"
  "We are too mean and insignificant for your notice. Why don't you go somewhere else...? Unless of course you want to spend lots of money in our bazaar?"
  "Take warning! Our emporium contains many weapons which the ~race~ will use to defend ourselves!~p~Of course, we also sell these, if the price is right."
 Trader (Neutral)
  "Welcome, welcome! Always a pleasure, pleasure to see a friend again. Wait, wait, don't tell me... I know I have your information around here somewhere. We've met before yes? I'd never forget a ship as interesting as yours..."
  "Welcome, welcome and again welcome. That's a very interesting ship you have. I'd love to talk to your engineers. Fascinating, fascinating. You must give me your details."
  "Oh, my! You startled us! You really should give a species fair warning when you intend to make first contact. What if the entire ~race~ had a fainting spell. It's happened before, you know. When we came to, we discovered mischievous aliens had drawn terrible things on our faces. In permanent marker!"
  "Welcome, welcome! Always a pleasure, pleasure to meet another friend, provided you are a friend of course...~p~Give us your name?"
  "We are in awe! ~player_creature_name~ strides among the stars like a race of giants!~p~We are the ~race~! We believe that the universal currency is happiness, and that the best way to achieve happiness is through free and unencumbered trade, in which each party agrees on the exchange and is made happier by the result!~p~How can we make you happy? Perhaps you would like to pass your eyes across the items in our emporium?"
 Shaman (Annoyed)
  "We want to finish this conversation business before your bad karma drops an anvil on your head."
  "Your aura is so... hostile. Removing you would abolish a major source of bad vibrations."
  "All you did was show up, and now all our clairvoyants are chanting, 'Kill, kill!'"
 Shaman (Neutral)
  "Friend. Who goes there?"
  "A new galactic presence is felt. Welcome.~p~What are you called?"
  "Your shape is unfamiliar, friend.~p~By what are you known?"
 Warrior (Annoyed)
  "Pay no attention to the many large weapons pointed directly at your brain. They are here for your protection."
  "State your case for continued existence."
  "The ~race~ are a reasonable people. We reason that your species might soon be crushed beneath our military might."
 Warrior (Neutral)
  "Halt. Identify yourself."
  "You stop. Give name."
  "Alien, who is you?"
  "What!? What do you want?~p~It seems like there's always some new galactic whippersnapper buzzin' in our ear, wantin' to make contact with the ~race~.~p~Well, fine, but you listen good: you stay off our lawns!~p~And any Frisbees we find there, we're keeping!"
 Grob

 Zealot
  "Praise Spode! Time to start spreading the word across the galaxy."
 Scientist
  "It was only logical that at some point our race would evolve into a space faring empire. We thank you for your contribution. "
 Trader
  "Our race thanks you for your kindness. We can now market our goods galaxy wide. "
 Shaman
  "Thank you for helping us transcend to the next level of physical and spiritual being. "
 Warrior
  "We hold much respect for you for your actions.~p~We have much work to do. Building a large fleet to secure our place in the galaxy doesn't happen over night. "
 Grob
  "These actions do not compute. "

New colony greetings:
 MySpecies
  "Greetings Captain. Your colony on planet ~planet_name~ is up and running!~p~It's a pleasure to speak to you directly."
  "Hail Captain! We have arrived on planet ~planet_name~ safely and are starting the unpacking process.~p~We're eager to start our Spice mining operation. As you know, if you invest in adding more buildings to the colony, it would help increase productivity. "
  "Greetings Captain! Planet ~planet_name~ appears to be a fine place to start a colony.~p~We look forward to serving you and our Empire. "
  "Good to hear from you Captain! Our colonizing operation appears to be going well on planet ~planet_name~.~p~Feel free to add more buildings to increase our productivity. "
  "Good day Captain! It appears you have made an excellent choice of planets to colonize.~p~Planet ~planet_name~ will be an excellent location to mine spice and establish a foothold in the galaxy. "

Player introduces self politely:
 Diplomat
  "The Grand Council hopes for a constructive dialog. "
  "We hope that a state of peace will always exist between our species. "
 Ecologist
  "We are all humble before the magnificent instrument that is Nature."
  "May all your worlds be fruitful! "
 Bard
  "And as for us, we're not humble at all!"
  "...and you have so much to be humble about! Just kidding. Really."
 Zealot
  "Humility is the first step to becoming a follower of Spode!"
  "The only true peace is the peace that Spode gives to his believers."
 Scientist
  "We hope for a productive exchange of information."
  "Let us reason together."
 Trader
  "If you're peaceful, we won't sell you weapons unless you insist!"
  "Beings of your magnificence are surely prepared to spend magnificently!"
 Shaman
  "All beings of true spiritual worth wish for nothing more than peace, harmony, and a distant chorus of angel voices."
  "Humility is the largest lily pad on the pond of wisdom!"
 Warrior
  "It is well that you approach us with humility, stranger."
  "As long as you retain your humility, we will have little to quarrel about."
 Grob
  "You will remain peaceful until we order you to war with our enemies."
  "It is well that you recognize our superiority."
 Response 1
  "It is an honor."

Player introduces self boastfully:
 Diplomat
  "Greatness is achieved only by service to a higher ideal than the self."
  "Boastfulness is a quality unsuited to a diplomat."
 Ecologist
  "That may be possible, but even so you are only an expression of the Universal Life Web."
  "Civilizations come and civilizations go, but Nature remains."
 Bard
  "If you're so great, how come we never heard of you?"
  "You may be great, but you're wandering lost in a town full of frowns!"
 Zealot
  "Any greatness you possess is but a mere reflection of the greatness of Spode."
  "You are animated dust. Only Spode is great. "
 Scientist
  "Does the data support that claim?"
  "Who besides you says that you're so great?"
 Trader
  "If you're so great and powerful, you'll want to spend lots of money in our emporium!"
  "We agree that you're absolutely tremendous! Will you spend money now?"
 Shaman
  "Boastfulness is a characteristic of the spiritually unevolved."
  "Our clairvoyants knew you were going to say that."
 Warrior
  "Perhaps one day this greatness shall be tested."
  "We look forward to a demonstration of this so-called greatness."
 Grob
  "We have encountered many civilizations that claimed greatness, and we have crushed them all."
  "On the contrary, you are nothing"
 Response 1
  "I'm not as small as you think. But let's continue..."

Player introduces self angrily:
 Diplomat
  "The Grand Council has every right to protect its citizens."
  "You have not yet achieved a status sufficient to give us orders."
 Ecologist
  "We act as we see fit within our own territory."
  "We do not recall inviting you here."
 Bard
  "~player_title~ seems a little petulant today, don't you think?"
  "Our weapons are tracking your every move, but only because we like you!"
 Zealot
  "We stand alert to guard Spode's People from unbelievers."
  "Speak more respectfully before the followers of Spode!"
 Scientist
  "It is illogical to expect us to obey your orders."
  "Your pointless aggression is the sign of an inferior intelligence."
 Trader
  "Just buy some stuff and leave, will you?"
  "Any unpleasantness from you, and we'll close the emporium!"
 Shaman
  "Why the belligerent aura, pilgrim?"
  "Chant with us, and be prepared to turn that frown upside-down!"
 Warrior
  "If you wish a test of skills, let it begin now."
  "It is a poor guest who threatens his host."
 Grob
  "Your threats mean nothing. "
  "If you wish to commit suicide, we will be happy to assist."
 Response 1
  "I sense some tension here. But let's continue..."

Greetings:
 Homeworld
  "Hail Captain ~player_creature_name~! Your home world of ~race_homeworld~ welcomes you with open arms.~p~I expect your journeys have produced quite a few tall tales. The whole of ~race_homeworld~ awaits news of your adventures. Please, tell us all you have seen and done."
 Colony
  "Well, lookit that. It looks like our favorite explorer has come a-callin'. It's always great to see a fellow ~player_creature_name~ way out here in the colonies. I hope you brought your appetite, 'cause we aim to fix you up a mess o'grub!"
 Diplomat (Furious)
  "The Grand Council graciously considers ~player_title~'s petition for capitulation. "
  "In order to explore all possible avenues for peace and security, the Grand Council gives ~player_title~ license to address us."
 Diplomat (Annoyed)
  "Has ~player_title~ come to a realization of the terrible consequences of your actions?"
  "The ~race~ stand fast against the aggression of ~player_title~. Talk quickly."
  "The Grand Council views ~player_title~ with suspicion. What do you want here?"
 Diplomat (Neutral)
  "The Grand Council views ~player_title~'s arrival with interest."
  "Please state the reason for ~player_title~'s visit to the ~race~."
  "The Grand Council wishes to know ~player_title~'s purpose here."
 Diplomat (Pleased)

  "In the name of the Grand Council, we greet you."
 Ecologist (Furious)
  "We are at war. Be thankful ~player_title~ still lives, and state your business."
  "Has ~player_title~ reconsidered your policy of viciousness and aggression?"
 Ecologist (Annoyed)
  "~player_title~, make this quick."
  "Kindly provide a justification for ~player_title~'s presence."
  "Is ~player_title~ here to learn proper behavior?"
 Ecologist (Neutral)
  "Hello. The ~race~ recognize ~player_title~. "
  "Greetings. We hope ~player_title~ will be brief."
  "We hope this discussion with ~player_title~ will help to serve nature."
 Ecologist (Pleased)
  "Greetings, Child of Nature. We are pleased to see our friend, ~player_title~."
  "Welcome to our sylvan abode, ~player_title~."
  "~player_title~ is welcome to join us in our worldly paradise."
  "Greetings, Child of Nature."
  "We surrender! Please! We...~p~Oh, hey, everyone! Look! It's ~player_creature_name~! What a relief! We thought maybe we were possibly under attack, so we thought it best to capitulate pre-emptively.~p~It's okay, everyone! Looks like we're not being enslaved after all. Carry on."
  "Oh dear, ~player_creature_name~.~p~You'll have to forgive us. Last week, all of ~race_homeworld~ came down with hysterical pregnancies. So, we've been busy sorting out that mess..."
 Bard (Furious)
  "Your violence is both useless and tedious in the extreme. And to think we once thought ~player_title~ was cute! "
  "If ~player_title~ surrenders, we could all have a big party!"
 Bard (Annoyed)
  "It's the boring old ~player_title~! Who let ~player_title~ in?"
  "Is it the ~player_title~, or has the headache come back?"
  "Here you are... just in time for us to appoint you the honorary subject in our Festival of Humiliations! Stick around and we'll send you some ripe garbage to get started."
  "Hey, it's our old nemesis, ~player_creature_name~! I was just thinking about your rotten carcass, and now here you are. Perhaps I am evolving psychic abilities. Let me see if I know what you're thinking now...~p~Hey, that's rude! You're a jerk!"
 Bard (Neutral)
  "We think we've seen ~player_title~ before. Or maybe it was someone else equally bland."
  "Hello! We hope that ~player_title~ will amuse us today."
  "~player_title~ is an odd creature, but oddly endearing. Maybe this visit will be fun."
 Bard (Pleased)
  "The ~race~ find ~player_title~'s antics an endless source of amusement! Welcome!"
  "It's the cute little ~player_title~ come back! We can have fun playing with the cute little ~player_title~!"
  "Your civilization is all grown up! Little ~player_title~ should be proud!"
  "Are you ready to be eaten yet?"
  "Well met, ~player_creature_name~! The ~race~ find you hearty and hale, no doubt? You must regale us with your many travails of derring-do and gallantry among the stars! We hang on your every breath! Our own tales will seem as bromides by comparison!"
  "Hark! From the very periphery of the Hubble volume itself, our noble hero from afar returns! How goes it? Do tell! Soon, all of ~race_homeworld~ shall be abuzz with stories of your exploits among the stars!"
 Zealot (Furious)
  "~player_title~ wars against Spode himself! Accept Spode or die!"
  "~player_title~'s extinction will serve Spode's Holy Plan!"
  "The Warriors of Spode will hold their fire for only a short time. Be brief."
 Zealot (Annoyed)
  "Beware, lest Spode unleash his wrath."
  "~player_title~ comes from outer darkness to seek the Light of Spode?"
  "The servants of Spode are busy. Be quick."
 Zealot (Neutral)
  "Greetings. The servants of Spode wonder what has brought ~player_title~ here."
  "Hello. Spode requires that we offer hospitality even to unbelievers."
  "Spode is the source of all hope. ~player_title~ would do well to listen to the Word of Spode. "
 Zealot (Pleased)
  "Greetings to our friend ~player_title~. Welcome in Spode's name."
  "We hope the servants of Spode may help ~player_title~."
  "Is ~player_title~ ready to hear the Word of Spode?"
  "I greet you in Spode's name."
 Scientist (Furious)
  "We'd like to see your head in a jar of formaldehyde!"
  "Get out the dissecting knives! The guest of honor has arrived!"
  "Let's just shoot first and reason afterward."
 Scientist (Annoyed)
  "Can ~player_title~ give us a reason not to dissect you immediately?"
  "We are reasoning beings. ~player_title~, however, we're not sure about."
  "Your species is a perfect argument against intelligent design."
 Scientist (Neutral)
  "We hope ~player_title~ is capable of intelligent conversation."
  "The ~race~ stand for reason and the advancement of knowledge. Does ~player_title~ stand for anything in particular?"
  "We are having a hard time fitting ~player_title~ into our taxonomy. Do you happen to know your phylum?"
 Scientist (Pleased)
  "Welcome, friend ~player_title~. Let us reason together."
  "How may the ~race~ aid its friend ~player_title~?"
  "We are met in the light of knowledge. Speak freely, ~player_title~."
  "Let us reason together."
 Trader (Furious)
  "We're at war! The boutique is closed!"
  "No matter how much ~player_title~ begs, we won't sell you things until you surrender!"
  "We are a peaceful people, but when aroused we are fierce!"
 Trader (Annoyed)
  "We hope that ~player_title~ is prepared to spend lots of money."
  "We are willing to trade even with the likes of ~player_title~."
  "You honor us with your presence. Now that we've been honored, will ~player_title~ go away?"
 Trader (Neutral)
  "We hope your splendor comes prepared to boost our economy."
  "The ~race~'s bazaar is closed for the moment, but we suppose we could open it if ~player_title~ promised to buy something."
  "Our delight in your presence is matched only by our hopes that ~player_title~ will visit our boutique."
 Trader (Pleased)
  "~player_title~ is rivaled in appearance only by the sun in splendor! Welcome! We regret that our emporium cannot equal your glory, but we hope you take a look at it anyway."
  "Your appearance is glorious, marred only by the lack of accessories. Perhaps we could sell ~player_title~ some?"
  "Ahh, my friend! I was wondering where that devilishly handsome galactic hero had gone off to. Have you lost weight? Are you working out? You look fabulous. Supple.~p~You should come by more often. The ~race_homeworld~oids make a great stir-fry. We'll have you over sometime! "
  "It's so lovely to see you again. It's a true delight for all of ~race_homeworld~ to deal with someone of your poise and station! You honor us with your presence... and those steely good looks! That's right - I'm comfortable enough with myself to say it! "
  "Greetings! Once again our eyes feast upon your magnificence. How can we make ~player_title~ happy?"
 Shaman (Furious)
  "Your vibrations are disharmonious. Speak quickly!"
  "Has ~player_title~ come to surrender?"
 Shaman (Annoyed)
  "It takes generations of bad karma to produce someone like ~player_title~. "
  "If you intend to impose a materialist lifestyle on us, you're sadly mistaken."
  "There is a special abyss in the afterlife reserved for those such as ~player_title~."
 Shaman (Neutral)
  "Hello, ~player_title~, may we rectify your spirits?"
  "~player_title~ has interrupted our aromatherapy session. But now that you're here, I suppose we can talk."
  "We are all made of star-stuff. Even ~player_title~. "
 Shaman (Pleased)
  "The ~race~ send you greetings, wanderer! ~player_title~, we perceive your benevolent aura."
  "How are you, friend ~player_title~? May we balance your yin and yang?"
  "Greetings, seeker ~player_title~. The ~race~ are pleased to greet you."

  "We welcome the honorable ~player_title~ to our security zone. "
  "~player_title~ has dealt with the ~race~ in honor. Therefore we honor you with our welcome."
  "Hmmm, what? I seem to recall you dimly. I know you're no threat, but that's about the nicest thing I have to say about you. Was there something you wanted? We probably won't help, but it don't cost nothin' to ask..."
  "The light of your species is not yet extinguished, we see."
